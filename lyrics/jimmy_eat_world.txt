Hey, don't write yourself off yet
It's only in your head you feel left out
or looked down on
Just try your best
Try everything you can
And don't you worry what they tell themselves when you're away
It just takes some time
Little girl, you're in the middle of the ride
Everything, everything will be just fine
Everything, everything will be all right, all right
Hey, you know they're all the same
You know you're doing better on your own (On your own)
So don't buy in
Live right now
(1409617727513)If you're listening (Woah oh oh oh oh)
Sing it back (Woah oh oh oh oh)
String from your tether unwinds
(String from your tether unwinds)
(Woah oh, woah oh)
Up and outward to bind
(Up and outward to bind)
(Woah oh, woah oh)
I was spinning free (Woah oh oh oh oh)
With a little sweet and simple numbing me
Are you listening? (Woah oh oh oh oh)
Sing it back (Woah oh oh oh oh)
So tell me what do I need?
(Tell me what do I need?)
(1409617727513)Love ain't never been your friend
Love never gonna hear what you're demanding
Love ain't some magical thing
Love never gonna be the way you're dreaming
It's gonna seem so far
It's gonna feel so hard
Until you want the work more than the reward
(1409617727513)There's no one in town I know
You gave us some place to go
I never said thank you for that
I thought I might get one more chance
What would you think of me now
So lucky, so strong, so proud?
Never said thank you for that
Now I'll never have a chance
May angels lead you in
Hear you me my friends
On sleepless roads, the sleepless go
May angels lead you in
(1409617727513)I'm not alone because the TV's on, yeah
I'm not crazy 'cause I take the right pills every day and rest
Clean your conscience
Clear your thoughts with speyside with your grain
Clean your conscience
Clear your thoughts with speyside
Salt, sweat, sugar on the asphalt
Our hearts littering the topsoil
Tune in
And we can get the last call
Our lives
Our coal
Salt, sweat, sugar on the asphalt
Our hearts littering the topsoil
Sign up
(1409617727513)I don't feel the way I've ever felt
I know
I'm gonna smile and not get worried
I try but it shows
Anyone can make what I have built
And better now
Anyone can find the same white pills
It takes my pain away
It's a lie A kiss with opened eyes
And she's not breathing back
Anything but bother me
(It takes my pain away)

(1409617727513)When there's no comfort in comfortable
The stolen chances and colored cars
You can invest with your full heart
You feel it crumble before you start
The path you didn't take, it always ends
Perfect only 'cause you never did
The moments that we have will soon be gone
Either you're here or you're not
(1409617727513)Hands will take their place
Far from intentions made
Disguised as patience, time gets wasted
Now is for the now, so get loud
I'm, I'm destination addicted
I just gotta be some place else
Never good time, never feel the space to get it right
Get right
Hands will find their way
(1409617727513)Hey, don't write yourself off yet
It's only in your head you feel left out or looked down on.
Just try your best, try everything you can.
And don't you worry what they tell themselves when you're away.
It just takes some time,
Little girl, you're in the middle of the ride.
Everything, everything will be just fine,
Everything, everything will be alright, alright.
Hey, you know they're all the same.
You know you're doing better on your own (on your own), so don't buy in.
(1409617727513)I was scared but once I thought about, I let it go
Everything she said to me, I guess I ought to know
We're all tired of talk when it comes to shove
Put up, put out, or stay at home
We'll never be the same, never feel this way again
I'd give you anything but you want pain
A little water please, I taste you all over my teeth
Never again, just tonight, okay
All at once the music stopped, the feeling went away
(1409617727513)When you're on... I swear, you're on
You rip my heart right out
You rip my heart right out
I think the whole room can hear me clear my throat
You rip my heart right out
You rip my heart right out
If you still care at all, don't go tell me now
If you love me at all...
Don't call
Then out of no where,
You put me right back there
You rip my heart right out
You rip my heart right out
And we know what happens
When we get to your house
(1409617727513)We're losing several steps ahead, it's strange
Anything you do, anyway you move
Then with any strain it feels so helpless
I trap we build ourselves, we can be without
When you pulled away, I say it matters
With the quiet face, heartbreak I shatter
Then okay, we'll train but after
Nothing new to see, saying what you mean
When you pulled away
(1409617727513)Are you gonna
Live your life wonderin'
Standing in the back
Lookin' around?
Are you gonna
Waste your time
Thinkin' how you've grown up
Or how you missed out?
Th-Th-Th-Things are never gonna
Be the way you want
Where's it gonna
Get you acting serious?
Th-Th-Th-Things are never gonna
Be quite what you want
Or even at 25
You gotta start sometime
I'm on my feet
I'm on the floor
I'm good to go
Now all I need is just
To hear a song I know
I wanna always feel like
Part of this was mine
I wanna fall in love tonight
(1409617727513)I dont stand stand a chance againts the claw of answers
Fighting off your face across the pillow landscape
The list of things I feel is crazy amused
To me that i would need a second wake up
Its all that happening like their sayin like
And all we could fumble and fight
And what makes our love so hard to beat
Is it you, or is that you with me
But just a posibility, I have given anything
We played on me so much, only so much we cab tell ourselves
Is it you, or is that you with me
You like magnets, crowd of static
For everything is punishing but nothing happens
(1409617727513)I felt for sure last night
That once we said goodbye
No one else will know these lonely dreams
No one else will know that part of me
I'm still driving away
And I'm sorry every day
I won't always love these selfish things
I won't always live
Not stopping
It was my turn to decide
I knew this was our time
No one else will have me like you do
No one else will have me, only you
(1409617727513)When you pull me in sometimes I almost feel
...
The picture in my head is just too real
...
It's gonna be how it is, there's some things you don't change
...
I'm done with telling myself that story
...
How slowly we built the walls
Years they pile up
I will steal you back
Funny how the smallest lie

(1409617727513)The first star I see may not be a star
We can't do a thing but wait
So let's wait for one more
And the time's such clumsy time
In deciding if it's time
I'm careful but not sure how it goes
You can lose yourself in your courage

(1409617727513)The clever ways I try to change
Happen and pass leaving me the same
Of course it must be something else
Leading questions I might ask myself
Sure and certain
Wander 'til we're old
Lost and lurking
Wonder 'til we're cold
(1409617727513)Well you're just across the street
Looks a mile to my feet
I wanna go to you
Funny, how I'm nervous still
I've always been the easy kill
I guess I always will
Could it be that everything goes 'round by chance?
(Chance, chance)
Or only one way that it was always meant to be?
(Be)
You kill me you always know the perfect thing to say
Hey, hey, hey, hey
I know what I should do
But I just cannot walk away
I can picture your face well
From the bar in my hotel
(1409617727513)Riddles keep me up at night
A lonely feeling to be understood
You told me often how it was
But I wasn't ready to hear it so plain
Amazing the effort we put in
Amazing the emotional bridges, tunnels, roads, and ways
We go around what's one step from our face
I see it clearly now
Honey, you are free
As much as you can stand to be
You are free
And it's anything you think that means
You are free
To be who you want
What you need
Yeah, who you want
What you need
(1409617727513)It's how the hustle goes
See what the jukebox knows
Put my last quarter on
I play "Authority Song"
Honesty or mystery?
Tell me, I'm not scared anymore
(Iiii Iiii)
I got no secret purpose
I don't seem obvious, do I?
(do Iiii? do Iiii?)
I don't seem obvious, do I?
(do Iiii? do Iiii? do Iiii?)
(I don't seem obvious do I?)
The DJ never has it
J A M C, automatic
(do Iiii?)
If those were Roy's headphones
You bet he'd play "What Goes On"
(do Iiii?)
(1409617727513)I wish I could hold
I wish I could touch
But a fool just wants and wants
It's all what you do when no one cares
No one's chasing you
No one's making you
Spend lonely nights poisoned through and through
It's all what you do when no one is there
(1409617727513)Before this world starts up again
It's me and night
We wait for the sun
The kids and drunks head back inside
Well there's lots of smart ideas
In books I've never read
When the girls come talk to me
I wish to hell I had
Get up! Get up!
Turn the ignition
Get up! Get up!
Fire up the system
Play my little part in something big
I'll accept with poise, with grace
When they draw my name from the lottery
And they'll say: “all the salt in the world couldn't melt that ice”
(1409617727513)I have a ringing in my head
And no one to help me answer it
Even with you close enough to kiss
Every minute is arranged
Every moment lasts a day
But thinking about it can't help me let go
I know
Talk, talking a lot
But it's still talk
Gotta love how it's somehow all on me
All the petty scenes
And all the pretty things
Say whatever you want
'Cause I can laugh it off
Heh heh heh, heh heh
I can laugh it off
Heh heh heh, heh heh
I must look like I'm running away
To you at your faster pace
I wonder what it is you could have seen
In me
(1409617727513)You close your eyes and kiss your hand then you blow it
But it isn't meant for me, and I notice
If the choice was ours alone,
Then why'd we both choose letting go?
Does it end like this?
Time never had a chance to heal your heart
Just a number always counting down to a new start
If you always knew the truth
Then the world will spin around you
Are you dizzy yet?
Respectfully, some honesty I'm calling out
Do you hear the conversation we talk about?
Oh back away to the safety of a quiet house
If there's half a chance in this moment
When your eyes meet mine, we show it

(1409617727513)If you only once would let me
Only just one time
Then be happy with the consequence
With whatever's gonna happen tonight
Don't think we're not serious
When's it ever not?
The love we make is give and it's take
I'm game to play along
All I can say
I shouldn't say
Can we take a ride?
Get out of this place while we still have time
(1409617727513)I don't care what you do
I'm getting out
No, nothing ever shames me
Don't want a thing from you
I'm going out
I don't care if you're angry
Oh, oh
I'm getting out
No, nothing ever shames me
Oh, oh
I'm going out
I don't care if you're angry
I should have thought things through
I'm holding out
Not getting an answer
I want to do right by you
I'm finding out
That cheating gets it faster

(1409617727513)Ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo, ooo ooo
Ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo
Ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo, ooo ooo
Ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo
Lay back baby an' we'll do this right
There's blankets in back we can use
I'll start the car, but we'll stay in park
The cold can kill us, before fumes
Now's the right time, for a good song
Got something to say, what I can't
Do you feel bad, like I feel bad?
Pour us a road, we'll both drink and drive
Kiss me with your cherry lipstick
Never wash you off my face
Hit me, I can take your cheap shots
Leave you with the love we made
Ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo, ooo ooo
Ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo
Come alive on the drivers side
So close, I taste your breath
Your lips go dry, but they're sweet inside
Wine must go right to your head
(Aaa)
It'd be easy, if you get mad
But three fingers point back to you
(1409617727513)The story is common
So plain we pass by often
All motion defeated
By endless what-if questions
Obvious, we own it
Our anxious scars and bruises
Heavy hands swing slowly
With weight of our own choosing, now…
We know but can't believe it's easy as it sounds
(1409617727513)I came up like everyone
They taught us all the same
I said what they told me to say
And then from that, they grade
Give up repeating the facts
Fact can be arranged
Here I am, I'll take my chance
Now play the record straight
Give it up
Oh oh, oh oh oh oh, oh oh, oh
Give it up
Oh oh, oh oh oh oh, oh oh, oh
Talking points from talking heads
With automated smiles
"There's no higher ground to stand
(1409617727513)This time it's on my own
Minutes from somewhere else
Somewhere I made a wish with Lucky Denver Mint
You're not bigger than this, not better
Why can't you learn?
You're not bigger than this, not better
Why can't you learn?
Hurry go on ahead
Good things won't let you wait
I'll catch up when we get home
(1409617727513)I'll say it straight and plain, I know I've made mistakes
I've always been afraid
A thousand nights or more, I traveled east and north
Please answer the door
Can you tell me?
You say that love goes anywhere
In your darkest time, it's just enough to know it's there
When you go I'll let you be
But you're killing everything in me
Get down on your knees, whisper what I need
Something pretty
(1409617727513)Sounds so great, everything you're saying
Do lies out loud change anything?
Go get mad
Have a child's tantrum
'Til everyone knows how wronged you've been
Look around, that's not me
Not one shred of who I'll be
You don't know what I do
The one way getting out is through
(1409617727513)Could have been a night like any other
One of us has to drive
One of us gets to think
I'll force a laugh to break the silence
It's gonna get harder still
Before it gets easy
You can't keep safe what wants to break
I'm alone in this
I'm as I've always been
Right behind what's happening
She's lost in this
She's like she'll always be
A little far for me to reach
I was just a boy like every other
(1409617727513)I see it around me
I see it in everything
I could be so much more than this
I said my goodbyes
This is my sundown
I'm gonna be so much more than this
With one hand high
You'll show them your progress
You'll take your time
But no one cares
No one cares
(1409617727513)I'm not exactly sure what I should say
Everything I do is a mistake
Your attention is attention (It doesn't matter if it's fake or real)
I'll take it if I get it, oh
I've made up my mind
I'll do it over any time
You're over it, over me
Present just physically
Last words from the dying scene
You're over me
You're over me
(1409617727513)Stay with me, you're the one I need
You make the hardest things seem easy
Keep my heart somewhere drugs don't go
Where the sun shines slow, always keep me close
If only you could see
The stranger next to me
You promise, you promise that you're done
But I can't tell you from the drugs
Don't let go, we'll dig a great big hole
Down an endless hole we'll both go
You're so blind, you can't save me this time
Hope comes from inside and I feel so low tonight

(1409617727513)There must be a plan that neither of us could see
So we went along where it went
A party within a dream
And I never felt peace like that
It was safety as I'd never known
Oh, I knew nothing
I was sick
And I don't blame a thing that you did
It doesn't have to hurt anymore
No, it doesn't have to hurt anymore
Any, anymore

(1409617727513)Thank you, honey
For reminding me
How long you can stare at someone and never see
Really see
Want so bad just to understand
Not going to let more time go
Without trying
Without trying
We build, we box, we carry on
As people we forgot
Strange, we come to find ourselves
Not knowing we're lost
(1409617727513)I walked out at 3 a.m.
The coward inside me told me so
I couldn't stand to lie with you
'Cause when I do I can tell
It's bye bye love
Bye bye love
It's bye bye love
Bye bye love
I wanna feel that golden light
(1409617727513)Are you going to live your life wondering?
Standing in the back looking around
Are you going to waste your time thinking?
How you've grown up or how you missed out
T-T-Things are never going be the way you want
Where's it going to get you acting serious
T-T-Things are never going to be quite what you want
Even at twenty five you got to start sometime
I'm on my feet, I'm on the floor, I'm good to go
Now all I need is just to hear a song I know
I want to always feel like part of this was mine
I want to fall in love tonight
Are you going to live your life?
Standing in the back looking around
(1409617727513)I got a story, it's almost finished
Now all I need is someone to tell it to, maybe that's you
Our time is borrowed and spent too freely
Every minute I have needs to be made up, but how?
I'm looking for a nice way to say I'm out
I want out
I fall asleep with my friends around me
Only place I know I feel safe, I'm gonna call this home
The open road is still miles away
Hey, nothing serious, we still have our fun, or we had it once
But windows open and close
That's just how it goes

(1409617727513)What's wrong baby?
Don't they treat you like they should?
Did you take them for it
Every penny that you could?
We once walked out on the beach
And once I almost touched your hand
Oh, how I dreamed to finally say such things
Then only to pretend
Don't you know what I'm thinking?
(Know that I'm thinking)
Driving 405 past midnight
You know I miss you
(Don't you know that I miss you)
Ninth and ash on a Tuesday night
I would write to you from museum mile
I toast to you
Your whisper
Your smile
Up the stairs at Weatherford
A ghost each place I hide
If you don't don't know, why'd you say so?
(1409617727513)Faintest snow keep falling, falling
Hands around your waist
Nameless, standing cold, standing cold
Like a breath, like a breath
Take in restraint like a breath
My lungs are so numb from holding back
(1409617727513)There's a sound that's true, but the voice is new
And a half-dancing attempt to learn you name
Right place and time for the haze and lights
There's a chance I meet your eyes if I move in
Someday we might not bother
Line up the way we should
Why not? The sun just feels too good
Sometimes the right one finds us
Who cares why they do?
Why not? We jumped because could

(1409617727513)Thanks for the offer, but I'm not scared
Spend my birthday alone
Miles of water, sun, and sand
A gift I give myself
No one in sight for help
I walked at random 'til I lost everyone
Some corner of Hyde Park
Got to my knees and planted hands
And let the world go dark
Wondering where you are
Somewhere spinning like me
Oh, baby, I can dream
First they'll think you're lost, but you're not
(1409617727513)Let the water come
She's the only one I love
Let the fat man drop
She's the sweetest honey pop
Will they see the sky again?
Who will sing their blues for them?

(1409617727513)I've spent my last nights
strung up and pulled tight.
Holding out, sleep and grow.
An answer comes without a please:
'Do what you want.'
[Chorus:]
Wonder why I'm so caught of guard when we kiss.
Rather live my life in regret then do this.
What happened to the love we both knew?
We both chased.
Hanging on a cigarette you need me,
you burn me you'll burn me.

(1409617727513)I'm a suspect, I'm a traitor
I'm only here in body visiting
Yellow faces and the distant screams
The beauty is in what isn't said
I'm rising to my feet
Because tonight, the world turned in me
Because right now, I don't dare to breathe
Oh, babe, I know
It's alive, and somewhere for us to find tonight
Chase this light with me
My gesso, my last call
My life is yours in your gifted hands
(1409617727513)I stumble in as something not to say
I needed time so I took it and got me some space
Oh it isn’t that I understand
Just wondering whatever I am
And the look you give is not enough
And you don’t see how it could be equally be turning me off
I guess there’s some things, you should never have, never known about
We got a good thing, but you’re better off not asking me how
Well is it so mean, just to let it pass, let it all go
Because there’s some things, you should never have,
Never known about, no never known about, no never known

(1409617727513)
