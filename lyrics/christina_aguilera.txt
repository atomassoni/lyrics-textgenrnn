Don't look at me
Every day is so wonderful
Then suddenly it's hard to breathe.
Now and then I get insecure
From all the pain, I'm so ashamed.
I am beautiful no matter what they say.
Words can't bring me down.
I am beautiful in every single way.
Yes, words can't bring me down... Oh no.
So don't you bring me down today.
To all your friends you're delirious,
So consumed in all your doom.
(1409617727513)Come on come on
Um yeah
Oh... w-o-o... come on come on
Uh
I feel like I've been locked up tight for a century of lonely nights
Waiting for someone to release me
You're licking your lips and blowing kisses my way but that don't mean I'm gonna give it away
Baby baby baby
(baby baby baby)
Oh... w-h-o-a...
My body's saying let's go (go)
Oh... w-h-o-a...
But my heart is saying no (no)
If you wanna be with me baby there's a price to pay
I'm a genie in a bottle
(genie in a bottle baby) Yeah
You gotta rub me the right way
If you wanna be with me
I can make your wish come true
You gotta make a big impression
(oh, yeah)
Gotta like what you do
(1409617727513)Seems like it was yesterday, when I saw your face
You told me how proud you were, but I walked away
If only I knew, what I know today
Ooh, ooh
I would hold you in my arms
I would take the pain away
Thank you for all you've done
Forgive all your mistakes
There's nothing I wouldn't do
To hear your voice again
Sometimes I wanna call you
But I know you won't be there
Ohh I'm sorry for blaming you
For everything I just couldn't do
(1409617727513)After all you put me through
You'd think I'd despise you
But in the end, I wanna thank you
'Cause you made that much stronger
Well I thought I knew you, thinkin' that you were true
Guess I, I couldn't trust, called your bluff
Time is up 'cause I've had enough
You were there by my side, always down for the ride
But your joy ride just came down in flames
'Cause your greed sold me out in shame
After all of the stealing and cheating
You probably think that I hold resentment for you
But, uh uh, oh no, you're wrong
'Cause if it wasn't for all that you tried to do
I wouldn't know just how capable
I am to pull through
So I wanna say thank you, cause it
Makes me that much stronger
Makes me work a little bit harder
It makes me that much wiser
So thanks for making me a fighter
Made me learn a little bit faster
Made my skin a little bit thicker
Makes me that much smarter
So thanks for making me a fighter
Never saw it coming, all of your backstabbing
Just so you could cash in on a good thing
Before I'd realized your game
(1409617727513)Se quebró la calma
Y el silencio en ruido se volvió
Quedaron desnudos
Nuestra imagen y nuestro dolor
Se mezclaba el cielo
Junto con la calle y el rencor
Nos llenó de miedo
Dónde fue el amor
Dime si el dolor despierta el alma
Dime si es capaz de despertar el corazón
Ni todo el rencor, ni la venganza
Nos va a poder calmar las ganas
De ver de nuevo aquellas caras
Dime si el dolor abre una puerta
Dime si es capaz de despertar el corazón
(1409617727513)Ooh, I'm overdue
Gimme some room
I'm coming through
Paid my dues
In the mood
Me and my girls gonna shake the room
DJ's spinning (show your hands)
Let's get dirrty (that's my chance)
I need that, uh, to get me off
Sweat'n til my clothes come off
It's explosive, speakers are pumpin' (oh)
Still jumping, six in the morning
Table dancing, glasses are crashin' (oh)
No question, time for some action
Temperature's up (can you feel it)
'bout to erupt
Gonna get my girls
Get your boys
Gonna make some noise
Wanna get rowdy
Gonna get a little unruly
Get it fired up in a hurry
Wanna get dirrty
It's about time that I came to start the party
Sweat dripping over my body
Dancing getting just a little naughty
Wanna get dirrty
It's about time for my arrival
Ah, heat is up
So ladies, fellas drop your cups
Body's hot front to back
(1409617727513)Ahora que ya mi vida se encuentra normal
Que tengo en casa quien sueña con verme llegar
Ahora puedo decir que me encuentro de pie
Ahora que me va muy bien
Ahora que con el tiempo logré superar
Aquel amor que por poco me llega a matar, no
Ahora ya
(Ahora ya) no hay más dolor
Ahora al fin
Vuelvo a ser yo
Pero me acuerdo de ti
Y otra vez pierdo la calma
Pero me acuerdo de ti
Y se me desgarra el alma
Pero me acuerdo de ti

(1409617727513)I could feel it from the start
Couldn't stand to be apart.
Something about you caught my eye
Something moved me deep inside!
Don't know what you did boy but
You had it and I've been hooked ever since.
I told my mother, my brother, my sister and my friend
I told the others, (Others) my lovers (Lovers) both past and present tense. (All right)
Everytime I see you everything starts making sense.
(Do your thang honey!)
Ain't no other man, can stand up next to you
Ain't no other man on the planet does what you do
(What you do).
You're the kinda guy, a girl finds in a blue moon.
You got soul, you got class.
You got style with your bad ass (Oh yeah!)
Ain't no other man its true (All right)
Ain't no other man but you.
Never thought I'd be all right. (No, No, No!)
Till you came and changed my life. (Yeah, yeah, yeah!)
What was cloudy now is clear! (Yeah, yeah!)
You're the light that I needed.

(1409617727513)Where's all my soul sisters
Let me hear y'all flow sisters
Hey, sister, go sister, soul sister, flow sister
Hey, sister, go sister, soul sister, go sister
He met Marmalade down in old Moulin Rouge

He sat in her boudoir while she freshened up
The boy drank all her magnolia-wine
On the black satin sheets oh I swear he started to freak
Itchi gitchi ya ya da da
(1409617727513)What a girl wants, what a girl needs
Yeah, c'mon!
I wanna thank you for givin' me time to breathe
Like a rock, you waited so patiently
While I got it together
While I figured it out (yeah, yeah)
I only looked, but I never touched
'Cause in my heart was a picture of us
Holdin' hands, makin' plans
And it's lucky for me, you understand
What a girl wants, what a girl needs
Whatever makes me happy, sets you free
And I'm thankin' you for knowin' exactly
What a girl wants, what a girl needs
Whatever keeps me in your arms
And I'm thankin' you for givin' it to me
What I want, is whatcha got
And whatcha got, is what I want
(1409617727513)When I'm lost in the rain
In your eyes I know I'll find
The light to light my way
When I'm scared, losing ground
When my world is going crazy
You can turn it all around, yes
And when I'm down you're there, pushing me to the top
You're always there giving me all you've got
For a shield, from the storm
For a friend, for a love to keep me safe and warm
I turn to you
For the strength, to be strong
For the will to carry on
For everything you do
For everything that's true
(1409617727513)Dirrty
Filthy (filthy)
Nasty, you nasty (yeah)
Too dirrty to clean my act up
If you ain't dirrty
You ain't here to party (woo!)
Ladies (move)
Gentlemen (move)
Somebody ring the alarm
A fire on the roof
Ring the alarm (and I'm throwin' elbows)
Ring the alarm (and I'm throwin' elbows)
Ring the alarm (and I'm throwin' elbows)
Oh, I'm overdue
Give me some room
I'm coming through
Paid my dues
In the mood
Me and the girls gonna shake the room
DJ's spinning (show your hands)
Let's get dirrty (that's my jam)
I need that, uh, to get me off
Sweat until my clothes come off
It's explosive, speakers are pumping
Still jumping, six in the morning
Table dancing, glasses are mashing
No question, time for some action
Temperature's up (can you feel it)
About to erupt
Gonna get my girls
Get your boys
Gonna make some noise
Wanna get rowdy
Gonna get a little unruly
Get it fired up in a hurry
Wanna get dirrty
It's about time that I came to start the party
(1409617727513)Seems like it was yesterday when I saw your face
You told me how proud you were, but I walked away
If only I knew what I know today, ooh, ooh
I would hold you in my arms, I would take the pain away
Thank you for all you've done, forgive all your mistakes
There's nothing I wouldn't do to hear your voice again
Sometimes I wanna call you but I know you won't be there
Oh, I'm sorry for blaming you
For everything I just couldn't do
(1409617727513)Vamos, vamos
Oh, ooh, ohh...
Vamos, vamos
Un siglo llevo en soledad
Atrapada queriendo escapar
Soñando que alguien, me libere
Me lanzas un beso
Yo te quiero amar
Pero hay un precio que tendrás que pagar
Para que me entregue (para que me entregue)
Oh oh oh oh oh
Mi cuerpo dice "Quiero"
Oh oh oh oh oh
Pero mi alma tiene miedo
Si me quieres junto a tí
Frota bien y ya verás
Como un genio liberado
Haré tus sueños realidad
Si me quieres junto a tí
Gánate mi corazón
Tres deseos te concedo (oh yeah)
Si me juras tu amor
Como un genio atrapado espero
Liberarme con tu amor sincero
Como un genio atrapado espero
Ven, ven, a sacarme de aquí
Bailando nos domina la pasión
(1409617727513)Young girl, don't cry
I'll be right here when your world starts to fall
Young girl, it's all right
Your tears will dry, you'll soon be free to fly
When you're safe inside your room you tend to dream
Of a place where nothing's harder than it seems
No one ever wants or bothers to explain
Of the heartache life can bring and what it means
When there's no one else
Look inside yourself
Like your oldest friend
Just trust the voice within
Then you'll find the strength
That will guide your way
If you will learn to begin
To trust the voice within
Young girl, don't hide
(1409617727513)H-m-m...
H-m-m...
Say what am I not supposed to have an opinion?
Should I keep quiet just because I'm a woman?
Call me a bitch cause I speak what's on my mind
Guess it's easier for you to swallow if I sat and smiled
(ooh...) When a female fires back
(ooh-ooh-ooh...) Suddenly the target don't know how to act
(ooh...) So he does what any little boy would do
(ooh...) Makin' up a few false rumors or two
(ooh...) That for sure is not a man to me
(ooh...) It's slanderin' names for popularity
(ooh...) It's sad you only get your fame through controversy
(it's so sad)
(ooh...) But now it's time for me to come and give you more to say
This is for my girls all around the world
Around the world
Who have come across a man that don't respect your worth
Oh-oh ooh
Thinkin' all women should be seen not heard
Oh... oh
What do we do girls?
(shout louder)
Lettin' 'em know we're gonna stand our ground
Stand our ground
Lift your hands high and wave 'em proud
Oh... ooh
Take a deep breath and say it loud
W-h-o-a
Never can never will
Can't hold us down
Nobody can hold us down
Nobody can hold us down
Nobody can hold us down
Never can never will
So what am I not supposed to say what I'm saying?
Are you offended with the message I'm bringin'
Call me whatever 'cause your words don't mean a thing
Guess you ain't even a man enough to handle what I sing
(ooh...) If you look back in history
(1409617727513)Ven conmigo, ven conmigo baby
Ven conmigo, ven conmigo baby
Oh yeah
Ven conmigo, ven conmigo baby
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Ven conmigo, ven conmigo baby
Es hoy la ocasion
Tengo listo en corazon, vienes tu, oh
Ya la fiesta comenzo
Bailaremos sin control, oh, oh
Amor llego la noche de los dos
Razon de amar y de celebracion
Juntos, tu y yo
Hasta que ilumine el sol, escucham Solamente tu, acercate a verme
Solamente tu, porque me enloqueces
Solamente tu, no me hagas esperar
Contigo quiero estar, ser tuya nada mas
Solamente tu

(1409617727513)No existe un momento del día
En que pueda apartarte de mí
El mundo parece distinto
Cuando no estás junto a mí
No hay bella melodía
En que no surjas tú
Ni yo quiero escucharla
Si no la escuchas tú

(1409617727513)Play something for me Alicia
There you go Chris. What's up?
I just got something on my mind!
Speak on it girl!
huuuuummm
wooooouuuooooh
ooouh oooouh
ooooooh (nooo)
It's impossible
It's impossible to love you
If you dont let me know what you're feeling
It's impossible for me to give you what you need
If you're always hidin' from me
I dont know what hurt you
But I just, I wanna make it right
(1409617727513)Look at me
You may think you see
Who i really am
But you'll never know me
Every day, is as if I play a part
Now I see
If I wear a mask
I can fool the world
But I cannot fool
My heart
Who is that girl I see
Staring straight back at me?
When will my reflection show
Who I am inside?
I am now
(1409617727513)Oh yeah, oh yeah
(Ooh) Oh
Como un bello amanecer
Tu amor un dia llego
Por ti dejo de llover y sol de nuevo salio, ooh
Iluminando mis noches vacias
Desde que te conoci
Todo en mi vida cambio
Supe al mirarte que al fin, se alejaria el dolor
Que para siempre seriamos dos
Enamorados, siempre de manos, enternamente
Si no te hubiera conocido no se que hubiera sido de mi
(Mi amor)
Sin tu mirada enamorada no se si yo podria vivir
Sin el latido de tu corazon
El mundo es mas frio
Nada tendria sentido
Si nunca te hubiera, conocido
(1409617727513)What do you do when you know something's bad for you
And you still can't let go?
I was naive
Your love was like candy
Artificially sweet
I was deceived by the wrapping
Got caught in your web
And I learned how to bleed
I was prey in your bed
And devoured completely
And it hurts my soul
'Cause I can't let go
All these walls are caving in
I can't stop my suffering
I hate to show that I've lost control
'Cause I, I keep going right back
To the one thing that I need to walk away from
I need to get away from ya
I need to walk away from ya
Get away, walk away, walk away
I should have known
I was used for amusement
Couldn't see through the smoke
It was all an illusion
Now I've been licking my wounds (licking my wounds)
But the vemon seeps deeper (deeper, deeper)
We both can seduce
But darling you hold me prisoner (prisoner)
I'm about to break
I can't stop this ache
I'm addicted to your allure
And I'm fiendin' for a cure
Every step I take
(1409617727513)Where's all mah soul sistas
Lemme hear ya'll flow sistas
Hey sista go sista soul sista flow sista
Ah
Hey sista go sista soul sista go sista
He met Marmalade down in old Moulin Rouge

Giuchie giuchie ya ya here

Mocha choca lata ya ya
(1409617727513)Come on over, come on over baby Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey boy don't you know
I got something going on
I've got an invitation
Don't you keep me waiting all night long
I know, you know, so baby don't
Pretend you won't, keep me guessing if you
You will or you won't
Don't wanna play that game with you baby
Said listen to me
All I want is you, come over here baby
All I want is you, you know you make me go crazy
All I want is you, now baby don't be shy
You better cross the line
I'm gonna love you right
'Cause all I want is you
Come on over, come on over baby Ohh... yeah yeah
I'm not just talking
About your sexuality (your sexuality)
But I can't help myself
(1409617727513)Ooh oh, hey
Hey... ooh ohh, hey
He comes from a foreign place
An island far away
Intrigues me with every move
Til' I'm breathless, I'm helpless
Can't keep my cool
Steals my heart when he takes my hand
And we dance, to the rhythm of the band
I feel his finger tips, grip my hips
And I slip as we dip into a rare bliss
Mama used to warn me
To beware of those Latin lovers
She said I gave my heart too soon
And that's how I became your mother
I said ay mama, you seem to forget
I'm not in love yet
Sweet talk don't win me over
But I realized
Big brown eyes can hypnotize
When he says
I am full blood boricua
Reads the tattoo on his arm
He tells me, mami I need ya
And my heartbeat pumps so strong
Getting lost in el ritmo
He whispers te quiero, te quiero
I begin to give in with no hesitation
Can't help my infatuation

(1409617727513)No te creo no
No me digas todo lo que piensas
No lo digas... no
Solo dime cuánto me deseas
Ay, de corazón
Que de amor tú no conoces nada
Y ese es mi dolor
Ojalá estuviera equivocada
Pero sé que no,
por eso nene
No me des falsas esperanzas
(1409617727513)Where's all mah soul sistas
Lemme hear ya'll flow sistas
Hey sista, go sista, soul sista, flow sista
Hey sista, go sista, soul sista, go sista
He met Marmalade down IN old Moulin Rouge
Struttin' her stuff on the street
She said, "Hello, hey Jo, you wanna give it a go?" Oh! uh huh
Giuchie, Giuchie, ya ya dada (Hey hey hey)
Giuchie, Giuchie, ya ya here (here)
Mocha Chocalata ya ya (oh yea)
Creole lady Marmalade
What What, What what
ooh oh
Voulez vous coucher avec moi ce soir
Voulez vous coucher avec moi
yea yea yea yea
He sat in her boudoir while she freshened up
Boy drank all that Magnolia wine
On her black satin sheets is where he started to freak
yeah

(1409617727513)Cuando estoy por caer
Yo sé que tu amor me volverá a socorrer
Venceré el temor
Mientras sepa que tu sientes
Dentro lo mismo que yo
En el dolor y el bien tu me supiste amar
Y lo que soy es por ti sin dudar...
Eres mi protecciôn, mi sostén
Frente a todo mi mejor opción
Por siempre tú...
Mi poder, mi valor, a través de lo peor
Mi luz mi cielo azul
Mi gran amor aún
Por siempre tú...
No hay ningún amanecer
(1409617727513)I'm leaving today
Living it
Leaving it
To change
Slowly drifting
Into a peaceful breeze
Tongue tied and twisted
Are all my memories
Celebrating a fantasy come true
Packing all my bags
Finally on the move
I'm leaving today
I'm living it
Oh I'm leaving it
To change
As I'm driving
I'm captured by the view
So much beauty
The road becomes my muse
The heat is rising
And my hand surfs through the wind
Cool, calm, collected
Is the child that lies within

(1409617727513)Come on over, come on over baby
Come on over, come on over baby
Come on over, come on over baby
Come on over, come on over baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey, boy, don't you know
I've got something going on (Yes, I do)
All my friends are gonna come gonna party all night long
I know, you know, I just want us to go
The fun we'll have you'll never be alone
So boy, won't you come?
We will party till the dawn. Listen to me
All I want is you (Come over here baby)
All I want is you (You make me go crazy)
All I want is you, now baby don't be shy (You better cross the line)
I'm gonna love you right (All I want is you!)

(1409617727513)People ask if I'm in love with you
Because I'm sitting here with
Your picture and smiling to myself
I'm kinda lost in my own thoughts of you
My heart speaks before my mind thinks through
And I blush as I say, "Yes"
What a feeling of vulnerability coming over me
And I'm feeling weak and I can't speak and I can't think
Never thought I'd give in so willingly to a human being
With abilities to set me free and let me be me
Makes me want to say
Your lips, your eyes, your smile, your kiss
I must admit it's a part of me
You please me, complete me, believe me
Like a melody
Your soul, your flow, your youth
(1409617727513)Hmm
Hmm
Say
What am I not supposed to have an opinion?
Should I keep quiet just because I'm a woman?
Call me a bitch cause I speak what's on my mind
Guess it's easier for you to swallow if I sat and smiled
When a female fires back
Suddenly the target don't know how to act
So he does what any little boy would do
Makin' up a few false rumors or two
That for sure is not a man to me
Slanderin' names for popularity
It's sad you only get your fame through controversy
But now it's time for me to come and give you more to say
This is for my girls all around the world
(around the world)
Who have come across a man that don't respect your worth, ohh
Thinkin' all women should be seen not heard
Ohh
So what do we do girls, shout louder
Lettin 'em know we're gonna stand our ground
So lift your hands high and wave 'em proud
Take a deep breath and say it loud
Whoaa
Never can, never will
Can't hold us down
Nobody can hold us down
Nobody can hold us down
Nobody can hold us down
Never can, never will...
So
What am I not supposed to say what I'm saying?
Are you offended with the message I'm bringin'
Call me whatever 'cause your words don't mean a thing
Guess you ain't even a man enough to handle what I sing
If you look back in history
It's a common double standard of society
The guy gets all the glory the more he can score
(1409617727513)You make me feel so emotional
So emotional, so emotional
It's either black or white that's right
We're makin' love or we're in a fight
Sometimes you make me so blue
Oh, but then it feels so good, I knew it would
You do the things that make me crazy
I want to give it to you, oh yes
You make me feel so emotional
I can't let go I'm so emotional
I'm sinking fast into an ocean full of you
Oh, I'm so emotional
You take me high and low you know
I'm never sure which way you're gonna go
(1409617727513)I remember when it all first began
We were tight right from the start
It wasn't long before you came on strong
Trying hard to win my heart (trying to win it)
I played hard to get but I couldn't help
Givin' up my heart in the end
You were thoughtful
Careful not to hurt the relationship
What happened to those days
When you used to be compassionate
Caring what I thought and said
So attentive gentleman
Now it's hard to turn your head away from the TV set
Taking me for granted lately
And frankly, it's gotta quit
Chorus:
I feel underappreciated
Now girls help me out
If you know what I'm talking about
(1409617727513)Once upon a time there was a girl
In her early years she had to learn
How to grow up living in a war that she called home
Never knew just where to turn for shelter from the storm
It hurt me to see the pain across my mother's face
Every time my father's fist would put her in her place
Hearing all the yelling I would cry up in my room
Hoping it would be over soon
Bruises fade, father, but the pain remains the same
And I still remember how you kept me so afraid

(1409617727513)Yo te contaré, una historia
De como un puertorriqueño me robó el corazón
Nunca más he vuelto a amar de esa manera
(1409617727513)Hey there boy did ya happen to know 
Wherever you go I'll follow 
Ooh babe you're like a cool breeze 
On a summer day 
When you're near me 
I don't know what to do 
I feel like a fool 
Like a school girl 
True blue girl 
Who wants to know 
Can you come out and play
You make me feel the way 
A woman is supposed to feel 
Let me show you 
Show you that my love's for real 
 
[Chorus]
I'll be the rain in your summer 
The chill in your fall 
I'll be watcha want 
Anything at all 
I've got a love for all seasons 
A love for all time 
I'll be the fire in your winter 
The sun in your spring 
I'll do what you want 
Give ya everything 
I've got a love for all seasons 
A love for all time 

I'll be there for you 
Keepin you warm 
Through the storm 
I'll guide you 
Stand by you until the stars 
Fall from the sky 
When you call me 
I never hesitate 
Makin you wait for my love 
Never lie love 
It's something that I just can't deny 
(1409617727513)No one ever said that love was gonna be easy
Gotta take the ups and downs, the in-betweens
If you take this journey, gotta give yourself completely
Never let nobody ever step on our dreams
You better stop
Listen to these words that I say
You better stop
Don't you throw this good thing away
Put your trust in me
And I'll make you see
No the rain won't last forever
Find a way to make it better
Long as we can stand together
Love will find a way
Gonna make a new tomorrow
Say goodbye to tears and sorrow
Better listen when I say
Love will find a way
Somebody tried to tell me love don't last forever
Said it only happens in your wildest dreams
After all is said and done we're still here together
Never listen to the lies and jealousy
You better stop
Don't you let them turn you around
(1409617727513)Oh yeah, oh yeah
(Ooh)
Oh
Como un bello amanecer
Tu amor un dia llego
Por ti dejo de llover y sol de nuevo salio, uh
lluminando mis noches vacias
Desde que te conoci
Todo en mi vida cambio
Supe al mirarte que al fin, se alegaria el dolor
Que para siempre seriamos dos
Enamorados, siempre de manos, enternamente
Si no te hubiera conocido no se que hubiera sido de mi
(Mi amor)
Sin tu mirada enamorada no se si yo podria vivir
(1409617727513)Ooh
Hay en mi corazón una inquietud
Hoy te veo tan distante
Hay algo que me aleja de tu amor
De repente tú cambiaste
Hoy insegura estoy
El estar sin ti, se que me hará sufrir.
Anoche yo sentí
Que me besaste diferente
Y me quede sin saber que hacer
Yo te conozco
Y se que algo no anda bien
Ven, dime la verdad, no quiero imaginar
Que fue el beso del final.
Ooh
No se por que ha cambiado tu actitud
Ojala que todo sea un error
No quiero comprobar que te perdí
Ni que nuestro amor se acabe
(1409617727513)Una mujer, quiere sentir
Una mujer, quiere sentir
Ooh ohh yeah, oh yeah
Yo te agradezco por insistir, por seguir
Dando tiempo a que me entregue a ti
Comprendiendo mis miedos, oh
Sin vencerte jamás (yeah yeah)
Me atrevo a ver pero sin tocar
Yo quiero más que una noche loca
Gracias por comprender
Por no ser impaciente y serme fiel
Una mujer, quiere sentir
Que es bien amada y no la harán sufrir
Y tendrás su amor, como lo soñaste
Una mujer, quiere sentir
Antes de darse que es feliz
Te dirá que sí, sin miedo a entregarse

(1409617727513)Baby you pretend that things
Ain't what they seem
All this tension of titling
Just exactly what we should be
Now I don't mind us being
Some kind of casual thing
Listen, all I wanna do for now
Is have you come and take all of me
Can you
Put your hands on my waistline
Want your skin up against mine
Move my hips to the baseline
Let me get mine, you get yours
Hang a please don't disturb sign
Put my back into a slow grind
Sending chills up and down my spine
Let me get mine, you get yours
If you see me with a man
Understand that you can't question me
The feelings that you caught
Ain't my fault, can't help your jealousy
If you can handle the fact that
What we have has got to be commitment free
Then we can keep this undercover lovin', cummin'
(1409617727513)Waited a long time for this
Feels right now
Uh, uh, ha, ha
Allow me to introduce myself
Want you to come a little closer
I'd like you to get to know me a little bit better
(1409617727513)I can't believe what you did to me
Down on my knees and I need to break free
All these years you violated me
(violated me)
I don't know why I can't feel inside
I try to hide can't make it alright, it's overkill
Now I'm ready to fight
(ready to fight)
I don't need nobody tryin' to make me over
I just wanna live simple and free
I just wanna get away
Savin' all your bullshit for another day
Feeling confined like I'm bein' force fed
My visions blurry and I'm lost in regrets
It's overload and I'm outta control
(1409617727513)Ooh sorry, if I ain't perfect
Sorry I don't give a (what)
Sorry, I ain't a diva
