I can't fool myself, I don't want nobody else to ever love me
You are my shinin' star, my guiding light, my love fantasy
There's not a minute, hour, day or night that I don't love you
You're at the top of my list 'cause I'm always thinkin' of you
I still remember in the days when I scared to touch you
How I spent my day dreamin' plannin' how to say I love you
You must have known that I had feelings deep enough to swim in
That's when you opened up your heart and you told me to come in
Oh, my love
A thousand kisses from you is never too much
I just don't wanna stop
Oh, my love
A million days in your arms is never too much
(1409617727513)Back when I was a child
Before life removed all the innocence
My father would lift me high
And dance with my mother and me and then
Spin me around till I fell asleep
Then up the stairs he would carry me
And I knew for sure I was loved
If I could get another chance
Another walk, another dance with him
I'd play a song that would never ever end
How I'd love love love, to dance with my father again

(1409617727513)When I look in your eyes
There I see
Just what you mean to me
Here in my heart I believe
Your love is all I'll ever need
Holdin' you close through the night
I need you, yeah
I look in your eyes and there I see
What happiness really means
The love that we share makes life so sweet
Together we'll always be
This pledge of love feels so right
And, ooh, I need you
Here and now
I promise to love faithfully You're all I need
Here and now
I vow to be one with thee, hey
(1409617727513)Always and forever
Each moment with you
Is just like a dream to me
That somehow came true, yeah
And I know tomorrow
Will still be the same
'Cause we got a life of love
That won't ever change and
Everyday love me your own special way
Melt all my heart away with a smile
Take time to tell me you really care
And we'll share tomorrow together
(1409617727513)My love
There's only you in my life
The only thing that's right
Oh yeah
My first love (yeah)
You're every breath that I take
You're every step I make
(Oh)
And I (And I)
I want to share
All my love with you, hey yeah
No one else will do
And your eyes (your eyes, your eyes)
They tell me how much you care
Oh, yes
You will always be
My endless love
(1409617727513)Love has truly been good to me
Not even one sad day
Or minute have I had
Since you've come my way
I hope you know, I'd gladly go
Anywhere you'd take me
It's so amazing to be loved
I'd follow you to the moon in the sky above
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, I'd go
Got to tell you how you thrill me
I'm happy as I can be
You have come
And it's changed my whole world
Bye-bye sadness, hello mellow
What a wonderful day
It's so amazing to be loved
(1409617727513)Doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Oh... oh... oh... oh... oh...
A chair is still a chair
Even when there's no one sitting there
But a chair is not a house and a house is not a home
When there's no one there to hold you tight
And no one there you can kiss goodnight
Whoa... oh... oh... oh... oh... oh... oh...
Girl
A room is a still a room
Even when there's nothin' there but gloom
But a room is not a house and a house is not a home
When the two of us are far apart
(1409617727513)The closer I get to you
The more you make me see
By giving me all you've got
Your love has captured me
Over and over again
I try to tell myself that we
Could never be more than friends
And all the while inside
I knew it was real
The way you make me feel
Lying here next to you
Time just seems to fly
Needing you more and more
(1409617727513)Back when I was a child
Before life removed all the innocence
My father would lift me high
And dance with my mother and me and then
Spin me around til' I fell asleep
Then up the stairs he would carry me
And I knew for sure I was loved
If I could get another chance
Another walk, another dance with him
I'd play a song that would never ever end
How I'd love, love, love to dance with my father again, ooh
(1409617727513)He works hard to give her all he thinks she wants
But it tears her apart 'cause nothing's for her heart
He pulls in late to wake her up with a kiss goodnight
If he could only read her mind, she'd say
Buy me a rose
Call me from work
Open a door for me what would it hurt?
Show me you love me by the look in your eyes
These are the little things
I need the most in my life
Yeaaah
Now the days have grown
to years of feeling all alone
(1409617727513)I thought some time alone
Was what we really needed
You said this time would hurt more than it helps
But I couldn't see that
I thought it was the end
Of a beautiful story
And so I left the one I love at home to be alone, alone
And I tried and found out this one thing is true
That I'm nothing without you
I know better now
And I've had a change of heart
I'd rather have bad times with you
Than good times with someone else
I'd rather be beside you in a storm
Than safe and warm by myself
I'd rather have hard times together
Than to have it easy apart
I'd rather have the one who holds my heart
Yeah
And then I met someone
And thought she could replace you
(1409617727513)I fell asleep late last night
And I dreamed that the night
And almost half the day away
I just got up so that
I can hear her say
She's still in love
And no one can take her love away
Ooh love wakes me up everyday
And I thought no one
Would ever make me feel this way
It feels me up every time
I hear her say
She's still in love
And no one could take her love away
I wanna be loved
There's nothing better than love
What in the world
Could you ever be thinking of
It's better by far
So let yourself reach for that star
And go no matter how far
To the one you love
To love
And I mean all these words I've said
And you don't have to guess
(1409617727513)Let me hold you tight
If only for one night
Let me keep you near
To ease away your fear
It would be so nice
If only for one night
I won't tell a soul
No one has to know
If you want to be totally discreet
I'll be at your side
If only for one night
If only for one night
Your eyes say things
I never hear from you
And my knees are shaking too
(1409617727513)I speak to myself sometimes, and I say, "Oh my
In a lot of ways, you're a lucky guy
Now all you need is a chance to try
Any love"
In my heart there's a need to shout
Dyin', screamin', cryin' let me out
Are all those feelings that want to touch
Any love?
What a world for the lonely guy
Sometimes I feel I'm gonna lose my mind
Can anybody tell me just where to find
Any love, any love?
Everyone needs a love no doubt
Any love, Any love
Everybody feels alone without
Any love, any love
(1409617727513)I think sometimes I can read your mind
When you make things up I can tell you lie
I see the things that your man can't see
And I wonder what kind of man is he
The one who you say is your lover
Who you insist takes care of you under the covers
And who is there for you and loves you like no other
Then you kiss and tell me that you love me like a brother
If I didn't know better
I'd think that you were mine, you're with me all the time
If I didn't know better
I'd swear we're more than friends, you're touching me again
If I didn't know better
I'd think we were in love
Girl, do you wanna tell me something
Oh, oh, oh
(1409617727513)SINCE I LOST MY BABY
William Robinson, Jr and Warren Moore
The sun is shining, there's plenty of light
A new day is dawning, sunny and bright
But after I've been crying all night
The sun is cold and the new day seems old
Since I lost my baby
Oh since I lost my baby
The birds are singing and the children are playing
There's plenty of work and the bosses are paying
Not a sad word should a young heart be saying
But fun is a bore, and with money I'm poor
Since I lost my baby (Since I lost my baby)
Oh since I lost my baby
My baby, my baby, my baby
Next time I'll be kinder, to my baby
Won't you please help me find her (I've got to find that girl)
Someone just remind her (Someone just remind her x2)
Of this love she left behind her (Of Me)
(1409617727513)If this world were mine
I would place at your feet
All that I own
You've been so good to me
If this world were mine
I'd give the flowers the birds and the bees
And it'd be your love beside me
That would be all I need
If this world were mine
I'd give anything
If this world were mine
I would make you a king
With wealth untold
You could have anything
If this world were mine
I'd give your each day so sunny and blue
And if you wanted the moonlight
I'd give you that too
If this world were mine, oh, baby
I'd give you anything
(1409617727513)I wanna tell you, baby
The changes I've been goin' through
Missin' you, missin' you, oh... oh...
Till you come back to me
I don't know what I'm gonna do
N-n-n-no, n-n-no
Don't you remember you told me you loved me, baby
You said you'd be comin' back this way again, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, oh, baby
I love you
Yeah... I really do
Long ago
And oh, so far away
I fell in love with you
Before the second show
And your guitar
And you sound so sweet and clear
But you're not really here
It's just the radio
Don't you remember you told me you loved me, baby
You said you'd be comin' back this way again, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby, oh, baby, yeah
I love you
I really do

(1409617727513)When I say goodbye it is never for long
'Cause I know our love still lives on
It will be again exactly like it was
'Cause I believe in the power of love
When you're close I can feel the power
When it's love I can always tell
Love for me is the best thing now
It's something that I know so well
Hold me closer and every minute
Of every hour, feel the power of love, yeah
Hold me tighter and take me higher
And feel the fire of the power of love
Did you know that your feelings show
You thought your love was locked up inside
But when your senses start to overload
Love is something you should never hide
You've got to believe in love
It's a feeling that's next to none
Can't stop until we are one
With the power of love
Tell everyone to try
I promise you'll reach the sky
One thing that we can't deny
Is the power of love
So close your eyes and you can feel it
Comin' straight from above, it's the power of love
You can't deny it, so don't even try it
(1409617727513)Verse 1:
It's the middle of the night
And I can't sleep at all (I'm so uptight)
Tossin' and turnin' is how I've spent the time
I've got so much on my mind... hey
Something's got a hold on me
I think it's love, don't you agree?...(It's got to be)
I don't feel better
I know what I've got to do
I've got to get next to you
Chorus 1:
So I came here (for you to love)
In the pouring rain (for you to love)
And I know I'm ready (for you to love)
I'll be the best I can (honey, for you to love)
'Cause honey it's you I love

(1409617727513)The bad boy's swingin' (Ha, ha, ha, ha)
Oh Yeah (Do doobie, doobie, de, de)
Well alright, (Do doobie, doobie, de, de) oh yeah
(Yeah) Well alright, (Whoa, ey)
oh yeah (bad boy's swingin') (Do doobie, dwiddle, de, de)
Well alright, (Dwiddle, de, Dwiddle, de, Dwiddle, de)
oh yeah (Do, do, do, de, do, yeah)
Roll back the rug everybody, move all the tables and chairs
We're gonna have us a good time tonight
Every time that we meet, we skip and we dip to the beat, yeah
What in the world could be better than getting together again
The last time we had a party, it ended when the sun came up
That's why your mama told you that you couldn't go out (stay in the house)
(aaww), Bad boy, gonna sneak out tonight, he's gonna tip by her window
Cause he sure wants to go out and dance
Everyone's here, let 'em all in (oh yeah)
(1409617727513)Oh oh yeah yeah
Oh yeah, yeah yeah
So close to paradise but closer than I should be
It's like I'm along for the ride, it happened unexpectedly
Promised myself that I wouldn't ever love again
But you make me feel something, my mind's always on you
I was standing in the rain
(I thought about you)
I was riding on the train
(I thought about you)
Feeling high like I seem to do
Every time I think about you
Saw two lovers start to kiss
(I thought about you)
Had to hold back the tears
(I thought about you)
Other girls no more exist
All because I think about you
Nothing seems to help, I don't even know myself
I'm trying not to think of you but a heart does what it wants to do
Pass you by, see you smile and I must admit I get
So emotional, I think I'm falling for you
Bought a pillow for my room
(I thought about you)
Heard Alicia sing a tune
(I thought about you)
It sends my rocket to the moon
(Every time I think about you)
Happens every time oh
Right from this heart of mine
(I thought about you)
I wanted you every time
(1409617727513)Let me hold you tight
If only for one night
Let me keep you near
To ease away your fear
It would be so nice
If only for one night
I won't tell a soul
No one has to know
If you want to be totally discreet
I'll be at your side
If only for one night
Your eyes say things i never hear from you
And my knees are shakin too
But i'm willin to go thru
I must be crazy
Standin in this place
But i'm feeling no disgrace
For asking...

(1409617727513)A chair is still a chair
Even when there's no one sittin' there
But a chair is not a house
And a house is not a home
When there's no one there to hold you tight
And no one there you can kiss goodnight
Woah girl
A room is a still a room
Even when there's nothin' there but gloom
But a room is not a house
And a house is not a home
When the two of us are far apart
And one of us has a broken heart
Now and then I call your name
And suddenly your face appears
But it's just a crazy game
(1409617727513)I don't know how love could do this to me
I've waited and waited for someone I never see
But I'm so sentimental and I'm so hopeful you'll be here
So here I am every year, every Christmas
(yeah)
I've wished for you in my heart and in my head
And I got my answer that first moment that we met
And, oh yes, I believed you as you told me, as you said
You'd be here every year, every Christmas

(1409617727513)[Luther Vandross]
The closer I get to you 
The more you make me see 
By giving me all you've got (Tell me more) 
Your love has captured me 

Over and over again 
I try to tell myself that we 
Could never be more than friends 
But all the while, inside, I knew it was real 
The way you make me feel 
Lyin' here next to you 
Time just seems to fly 
Needing you more and more (More and more) 
Let's give love a try (Lets give love a try) 
I wanna try love 
(1409617727513)Your love's never been better
So good it's a sin
But it's time for a decision
Is it me or him?
Before you make your mind up, hear me
I just want you to see things clearly
This should be about love, not money
Don't let him try to take you from me
I don't wanna have to apologize
I don't wanna feel I've been penalized
Just 'cause I can drive in a better car
Live in a bigger house just like a superstar
He says that I can only give you
Material things, but that's not true
You see my heart is rich with love for you
Don't let him make you doubt my love for you
Yeah, baby
I work hard for my money
No one gave it to me
But some fools think the deeper the pocket
The smaller the heart will be, not true
I'm only tryin' to share me with you
Look at all the lovin' we do
Find the meaning in the words I'm sayin'
(1409617727513)Anyone who ever loved could look at me
And know that I love you
Anyone who ever dreamed could look at me
And know I dream of you
Knowing I love you so
Anyone who had a heart
Would take me in her arms and love me too
You couldn't really have a heart and hurt me
Like you hurt me and be so untrue
What am I to do
Every time you go away I always say
This time it's goodbye dear
Loving you the way I do I'd take you back
Without you I'd die dear

(1409617727513)A kiss in the dark a certain time I can call you
A letter of love but no name did you sign
Pretending to all that we were just friends when I saw you
I didn't know that you wanted me to be
I didn't know that you wanted me for your, to be
Your secret love, why can't we tell somebody
'Cause secret loves never last as long
Your secret love will never be your true love
I can't be no secret baby it's breakin' my heart
You should've let me know, from the first time baby
That you were not, were not free to love
How could you wait so long? Oh, what a waste of love, baby
(1409617727513)Yeah yeah
Here it is
She caught me by suprised I must say
Cause I never had seen such a pretty face
With such a warm and beatiful smile
It wasn't hard for me to notice her style
I was fasinated surly
She took my heart and held it for me
I wouldn't let her get away
Not until she heard me say
Excuse me miss (YEHHH)
But whats your name?
Where are you from and can I come?
And possibly can i take you out tonight?
To a movie, to the park (YEHHH)
I'll have you home before it's dark (WHOOOO)
So let me know, can I take you out tonight?
Don't care if i get rejected
At least then I won't regret it
Regret the fact i missed the chance for romance
At least I'll walk away knowing
I tried my best and i'm going
(1409617727513)It's gonna be tonight, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I can hear your singing, say you'll stay beside me
Why must it be, you'll always be into my dreams, hey hey
Mmm, oh-oh-oh, huggin' and sqeezing, huggin' and sqeezing
Why must it be you're always creepin?
Into my dreams? my, my, my dreams
When I sleep at night, baby, I feel these moments of ecstasy
(1409617727513)[Luther Vandross]
The closer I get to you 
The more you make me see 
By giving me all you've got (Tell me more) 
Your love has captured me 

Over and over again 
I try to tell myself that we 
Could never be more than friends 
But all the while, inside, I knew it was real

(1409617727513)PROMISE ME
Luther Vandross
(album: Forever, For Always, For Love - 1982)
I can only speak for
The things that I've been through
So when it comes to our love
I'll talk the whole night through
About the lovin' I've been missin'
Lately, baby I ain't had no kissin'
Don't you love me
Can we stay together
Bridge:
Like when we used to be in love
(1409617727513)Ay, love don't love you
Hey, love, ah ha
Time rushes on
And it's not fair
When someone you used to love
Is no longer there
But I think it's time you know
See love is a society
Any fool can not belong
Cuz the minute you hurt love
Then it's over and done
Love don't love you anymore
No more, shoulda never done wrong
Love don't love you anymore
No, no
Love is a ride, up and down, yeah
You did what you did to love
And I betcha know now
Cuz there's no one else around
And now you're running back to me
(1409617727513)You know
I've had a lot of things happen to me in my life
And yet
I don't spend much of my time
Feelin' sad
I don't let anything turn my sunshine to rain
I never have
Well, people have told me I'm not worth the time of day
Said I was over the hill
And it's been said that I always get in the way
But nothin' seemed to hurt me till
You stopped lovin'
You stopped lovin' me
Why'd you do that
You stopped lovin'
You stopped lovin' me
Lovin' me
And I don't want to do
Don't know what I'm gonna do, my love
(You stopped)
(You stopped)
(You stopped)
I just can't get it together since
(You stopped)
(You stopped)
(You stopped)
Oh

(1409617727513)Superman can fly high, way up in the sky
'Cause we believe he can
So what we choose to believe can always work out fine
It's all in the mind
So think of a place and imagine a time
Imagine a time, imagine a time
And let's go be lovers
Believing me, ooh we baby
Is believing right, yeah, yeah, yeah
And
I wanna love, wanna have, wanna hold you girl, girl
So make me a believer
Wanna love, wanna love, wanna love
Wanna love, wanna love, wanna girl
I wanna love, wanna have, wanna hold you girl, girl
(1409617727513)FOREVER, FOR ALWAYS, FOR LOVE
Luther Vandross
Spoken:
I sing this song
To remind myself that
There was a time when I
Didn't have no one
Didn't have no love
Do you remember
The love that we once had
Well, if I had the chance to love you again
I would make your heart forget I was ever bad
(1409617727513)When I say goodbye it is never for long
'Cause I know our love still lives on
It will be again exactly like it was
'Cause I believe in the power of love
When you're close I can feel the power
When it's love I can always tell
Love for me is the best thing now
It's something that I know so well
Hold me closer and every minute
Of every hour, feel the power of love, yeah
Hold me tighter and take me higher
And feel the fire of the power of love
Did you know that your feelings show
You thought your love was locked up inside
But when your senses start to overload
Love is something you should never hide
You've got to believe in love
It's a feeling that's next to none
Can't stop until we are one
With the power of love
Tell everyone to try
I promise you'll reach the sky
One thing that we can't deny
Is the power of love
So close your eyes and you can feel it
Comin' straight from above, it's the power of love
(1409617727513)I thought some time alone
was what we really needed
you said this time would hurt more than it helps
but I couldn't see that
I thought it was the end
of a beautiful story
and so I left the one I loved at home to be alone(alone)
and I tried and found
out this one thing is true
that I'm nothing without you
I know better now
and I've had a change of heart
I'd rather have bad times with you, than good times with someone else
I'd rather be beside you in a storm, than safe and warm by myself
I'd rather have hard times together, than to have it easy apart
I'd rather have the one who holds my heart
whoo-oo-oo-oo yeah
And then I met someone
(1409617727513)I used to be afraid
That you were never gonna love me this way
But I feel better now
No one could ever say
To me, it's such a shame you're a lonely guy
Because you love is mine
And now we know our love is ever so true
I think we know it 'cause you feel the way I do
I can't imagine me without you, my dear
And I'm so glad about the reason that you came here
Because it's love
Because it's love
Because it's really love
Because it's really love
Ooh, girl you gotta stay
'Cause I wanna fill your day with happiness
'Cause I'm in love you see
There's so much I wanna say
And you'll hear the words to make you fall in love
Deep in love with me
I used to say I love you every day
To make you really know, to trust in the things I say
But look at me now and you can clearly see
The love I feel for you, you don't need words from me
Because it's love
(1409617727513)It's about to be on
It's about to be on
Ya'll came here to give it up
So come on and show me what you got
It's about to be on baby non-stop
Tonight you're gonna get your time to shine
Nobody but stars in here tonight
Dancing underneath the party light
When I see you working that body right
Tonight you're gonna get your time to shine
I've been waiting, now I'm ready for the main event
All the ladies and the players in here dressed to kill
Choose a winner who has flavor looking on for style
Only the best can pass the test, let me check you out
In the midst of a fierce competition
Get a view from a better position
A little closer now you got my attention
Maybe your my, my, my, my, my superstar
Keep showing me moves that are blazing
'Cause you're teasing my imagination
Don't believe I can fight temptation
I think you already know that
Ya'll came here to give it up
So come on and show me what you got
It's about to be on baby non-stop
Tonight you're gonna get your time to shine

(1409617727513)If this world were mine
I would place at your feet
All that I own
You've been so good to me
If this world were mine
I'd give the flowers the birds and the bees
And it'd be your love beside me
That would be all I need
If this world were mine
I'd give you anything
If this world were mine
I would make you a king
With wealth untold
You could have anything
(1409617727513)Now, are y'all ready?
Are y'all ready?
Here we go now
Do it with the fever
Yeah, come on
Ain't no stoppin' us now
We're on the move
(Hey-yeah, hey-yeah)
Ain't no stoppin' us now
We've got the groove
(Spice Girls, check it out)
There've been so many things that have held us down
But now it looks like things are finally comin' around, yeah
I know we've got a long, long way to go, yeah
And were we'll end up, I don't know
But we won't let nothin' hold us back
We're gonna get ourselves together, ha
We're gon' polish up our act, yeah
And if you've ever been held down before
I know that you refuse to be held down any more, yeah-yeah
Don't you let nothin', nothin'
(Nothin' stand in your way, and all ago)
I want y'all to listen, listen
(That's right, to every word I say, every word I say about it)
Ain't no stoppin' us now (that's right)
(1409617727513)I'm an ever rolling wheel
Without a destination real
And I'm an ever spinning top
Whirling around 'till I drop
1 - Oh, but what am I to do
My mind is in a whirlpool
Give me a little hope
One small thing to cling to
2 - You got me going in circles
