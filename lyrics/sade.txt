And playing with another heart
Placing high stakes, making hearts ache

Jukebox life, diamond nights and ruby lights, high in the sky
Heaven help him, when he falls

Something heavenly led me to you
Look at the sky it's the colour of love
There must have been an angel by my side
Something heavenly came down from above
He led me to you he led me to you
He built a bridge to your heart all the way
How many tons of love inside I can't say
When I was led to you I knew you were the one for me
I swear whole world could feel my heartbeat
When I lay eyes on you
Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay
You wrapped me up in the colour of love
You gave me the kiss of life

If I tell you now
Will you keep on
Will you keep on loving me
If I tell you
If I tell you how I feel
Will you keep bringing out the best in me
You give me you give me the sweetest taboo
You give me you give me the sweetest taboo
Too good for me
There's a quiet storm and it never felt like this before
There's a quiet storm that is you...
There's a quiet storm and you never felt this hot before
Giving me something that's taboo
Sometimes I think you're just too good for me
You give me the sweetest taboo
(1409617727513)This may come, this may come as some surprise
But I miss you
I could see through all of your lies
But still I miss you
He takes her love, but it doesn't feel like mine
He tastes her kiss, her kisses are not wine, they're not mine
He takes, but surely she can't give what I'm feeling now
She takes, but surely she doesn't know how
Is it a crime
Is it a crime
That I still want you
(1409617727513)Your love is king
Crown you in my heart
Your love is king
Never need to part
Your kisses ring

It's making my soul sing
Tearing the very heart of me
Your love is king
(1409617727513)You're ruling the way that I move
And I breathe your air
You only can rescue me
This is my prayer
If you were mine
If you were mine
I wouldn't want to go to heaven
I cherish the day
Won't go astray
Won't be afraid
Won't catch me running
You're ruling the way that I move
You take my air
Show me how deep love can be
You're ruling the way that I move
I breathe your air
You only can rescue me
Rescue me
This is my prayer
I cherish the day
Won't go astray
(1409617727513)I've lost the use of my heart
But I'm still alive
Still looking for the life
The endless pool on the other side
It's a wild wild west
I'm doing my best
I'm at the borderline of my faith
I'm at the hinterland of my devotion
In the frontline of this battle of mine
But I'm still alive
I'm a soldier of love.
Every day and night
I'm soldier of love
All the days of my life
I've been torn up inside (oh!)
I've been left behind (oh!)
So I ride
I have the will to survive
In the wild wild west
Trying my hardest
Doing my best
To stay alive
(1409617727513)In heaven's name why are you walking away
Hang on to your love
In heaven's name why do you play these games
Hang on to your love
Take time if you're down on luck
It's so easy to walk out on love
Take your time if the going gets tough
It's so precious
So if you want it to get stronger
You'd better not let go
You gotta hold on longer
If you want your love to grow
Gotta stick together
Hand in glove
Hold tight, don't fight
Hang on to your love
In heaven's name why are you walking away
Hang on to your love
In heaven's name why do you play these games
Hang on to your love
Be brave when the journey is rough
It's not easy when you're in love
Don't be ashamed when the going gets tough
It's not easy don't give up
(1409617727513)If I tell you
If I tell you now
Will you keep on
Will you keep on loving me
If I tell you
If I tell you how I feel
Will you keep bringing out the best in me
You give me, you give me the sweetest taboo
You give me, you're giving me the sweetest taboo
Too good for me
There's a quiet storm
and it never felt like this before
There's a quiet storm
that is you
(1409617727513)I won't pretend that I intend to stop living
I won't pretend I'm good at forgiving
But I can't hate you
Though I have tried
Aaa, aaa, aaa, aaa, aaa
I still really, really love you
Love is stronger than pride
I still really, really love you
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
I won't pretend that I intend to stop living
I won't pretend I'm good at forgiving
(1409617727513)Jezebel wasn't born with a silver spoon in her mouth
She probably had less than every one of us
But when she knew how to walk she knew
how to bring the house down
Can't blame her for her beauty
She wins with her hands down
Jezebel, what a belle
Looks like a princess in her new dress
How did you get that?
Do you really want to know she said?
(1409617727513)He told me sweet lies of sweet loves
Heavy with the burden of the truth
And he spoke of his dreams
Broken by the burden
Broken by the burden of his youth
Fourteen years he said
I couldn't look into the sun
She saw him laying at the end of my gun
(1409617727513)I'm crying everyones tears
And there inside our private
war I died the night before
And all of these remnants
of joy and disaster
What am I supposed to do
I want to cook you a soup that
warms your soul
But nothing would change
nothing would change at all
Its just a day that brings
it all about
Just another day
And nothings any good
The DJ's playing the
same song
I have so much to do
I have to carry on
I wonder if this grief will
ever let me go
I feel like
I am the king
of sorrow

(1409617727513)I'd wash the sand off the shore
Give you the world if it was mine
Blow you right to my door
Feels fine
Feels like
You're mine
Feels right
So fine
I'm yours
You're mine
Like paradise
I'd give you the world if it was mine
(1409617727513)If you were mine
If you were mine
I wouldn't want to go
To heaven
I cherish the day
I won't go astray
I won't be afraid
You won't catch me running
You're ruling the way that I move
You take my air
You show me how deep love can be
You're ruling the way that I move
(1409617727513)I'm cryin' everyone's tears
And there inside our private war I died the night before
And all of these remnants of joy and disaster
What am I supposed to do?
I want to cook you a soup that warms your soul
But nothin' would change, nothin' would change at all
It's just a day that brings it all about
Just another day and nothin's any good
The D.J's playin' the same song
I have so much to do, I have to carry on
(1409617727513)i am in the wilderness
you are in the music in the man's car next to me
somewhere in my sadness
i know i won't fall apart
completely
when i need to be rescued
and i need a place to swim
i have a rock to cling to
in the storm
when no-one can hear
me calling
i have you i can sing to
and in all this
and in all my life
you are the lovers rock
the rock that i cling to
(1409617727513)In heaven's name why are you walking away
Hang on to your love
In heaven's name why do you play these games
Hang on to your love
Take time if you're down on luck
It's so easy to walk out on love
Take your time if the going gets tough
It's so precious
So if you want it to get stronger
You'd better not let go
You gotta hold on longer
If you want your love to grow

If you want it to get stronger
(1409617727513)Good times they come and they go
Never going to know
What fate is going to blow
Your way just hope that it feels right
Sometimes it comes and it goes
You take it ever so slow
And then you lose it
Then it flows right to you
So we rely on the past
Special moments that last
We're as tender as we dare to remember
Such a fine time as this
What could equal the bliss?
The thrill of the first kiss
It'll blow right to you
It's never... as good as the first time
Never... as good as the first time
(1409617727513)Always hope that you remember
We'll never really learn the meanin' of it all
What we have is strong and tender
So hold on
In the middle of the madness
When the time is runnin' out and you're left alone
All I want is you to know that
It's strong still, can't pull us apart
Nothing can come between us
Nothing can pull us apart
Can come between us
I always hope that you remember
(1409617727513)Think I'll just fall to pieces
If I don't find something else to do
This sadness never ceases
I'm still in love with you
My head, it keeps on reeling
It's got me in a crazy spin
Darling, darling, darling
Is this the end?
Still in love with you
(1409617727513)You think I'd leave your side baby
You know me better than that
You think I'd leave you down
When you're down on your knees
I wouldn't do that
I'll tell you you're right when you want
And if only you could see into me
Oh when you're cold
I'll be there
Hold you tight to me
When you're on the outside baby and you can't get in
I will show you

(1409617727513)I was the one
I who could
Pull in all the stars above
Lay them on your feet
And I gave you my love
(Ain't gon' let you go)
You are the one that got me started
You coulda let me
Love anyone, but I only wanted you
So why did it make me cry?
Why didn't you come get me one last time?
You'll always know
Reason why
We could have had
The moon and the sky
You'll always know
Reason why this love
Reason why this love
(1409617727513)We were waiting for the bus
No one much around but us
Then I see this young boy
Caught a look at me
I'm stunned in a daze
He had the whole street set ablaze
It's only love they say
Makes you feel this way
She liked his eyes, she wanted more
The baby gonna have your smile for sure
He saw a lovely girl
Smelling sweet and soapy like fresh air
She saw him looking, acted like she didn't care
That's how we knew
And so love grew a flower
A flower that is you
Your daddy knows you're a flame
Your daddy knows you're a flame
Your daddy knows you're a flame
Your daddy knows you're a flame
Even to the angels it may sound like a lie
(1409617727513)Words: sade adu
there must have been an angel by my side
something heavenly led me to you
look at the sky
it's the colour of love
there must have been an angel by my side
something heavenly came down from above
he led me to you
he led me to you
He built a bridge to your heart
all the way
how many tons of love inside
i can't say
When i was led to you
i knew you were the one for me
i swear the whole world could feel my heartbeat
(1409617727513)They come to see
A fire burning
In your heart
They want to witness
This love
From the start

(1409617727513)I always hope that you remember
Never really learn the meaning of it all
What we have is strong and tender so hold on
In the middle of the madness
When the time is running out and you're left alone
All I want is you to know that
It's strong still can't pull us apart
Nothing
(nothing can come)
Can come
(nothing can come)
Between us
Nothing can come between us
Nothing can pull us apart
Baby nothing can come
Can come
(nothing can come)

Papa been laid off
My brother's been laid off
For more than two years now
Ooh, can't get a job
Billy can't get a job
Ooh, they gotta listen to the blues

Help them to have some future
Help them to live long

If you don't make them dance
Don't let them stay home and listen to the blues
(1409617727513)There is a woman in Somalia
Scraping for pearls on the roadside
There's a force stronger than nature
Keeps her will alive
This is how she's dying
She's dying to survive
Don't know what she's made of
I would like to be that brave
She cries to the heaven above
(1409617727513)There is a woman in Somalia

There is a stone in my heart
(1409617727513)i see them gathered see
them on the shore
i turned to look once more
and he who knows me not takes me to the belly
of darkness
the tears run swift and hard and when they fall
even the comfort of a stone would be a gain
there was a time
when i thought
i would have to give up
but i'm thankful that i'm
strong as i am and i'll try to do
the best i can
tears will run swift and tears will come that fall like rain
i pray that it's swift though tears will fall as cold as pain
(1409617727513)I know that lately
Things haven't been so good
I always said
If I could ever help you I would
Ooh ooh ooh, Ooh ooh ooh, I love you
For a thousand years
, I'm here
To wipe away the tears
I will be your friend till the end of time
I will be your friend I'm here to make you smile
When you're falling apart
I pick up each piece and
Build a wall around your dreams
The punches to your heart
Melt away when you never thought they'd heal
(1409617727513)Grandma came to see
Something she could not believe
How could her girl be so naive
Tar baby
Tar baby told the secret she conceived
Oh... that big old smile of yours
Could turn the wind into a song
How could I have doubted
Honey it's with me that you belong
Tar baby
Tar baby I love you so
I love you
Like a brand new blade... you cut into my life
(1409617727513)i saw a picture
how could you be so careless
how could you have done that
to us
and i write this letter
i send it all back to you
and every word you said
in there every word
oh oh
how could you have done that to us
you treated me like a stranger
and all the time i was loving you
all your slick moves they were once innocent moves
i wanted to look up to you
i really trusted you
and every word you said

(1409617727513)Tell me why, tell me why, tell me why
Why can't we live together
Tell me why, tell me why
Why can't we live together
Everybody wants to live together
Why can't we be together
No more war, no more war, no more war
Just a little peace
No more war, no more war
All we want is some peace in this world

(1409617727513)You came along when I
Needed a savior
Someone to pull me
Through somehow
I've been torn apart so
Many times
I've been hurt so many
Times before
So I'm counting on you now
Somebody already
Broke my heart
Somebody already
Broke my heart
Here I am
So don't leave me stranded
(1409617727513)quietly while you were asleep
the moon and i were talking
i asked that she'd always keep you protected
she promised you her light that you so gracefully carry
you bring your light and shine like morning
(1409617727513)How could you? You are the river
Pour out of this life
How could you? You are the morning bird
Who sang me into life every day, fly away

(1409617727513)I was so in love with you
You rarely see a love
that's true
Wasn't that enough for you
Wasn't that enough for you
I would climb a mountain
I wouldn't want to see you fall
Rock climb for you
And give you a reason for it all
You kept on thinking
You were the only one
Too busy thinking
Love is a gun
Hit me like a slow bullet
(1409617727513)Son of
Son of a gun
Gotta find out what I meant to you
You're the one who broke my heart
Gotta find out what I meant to you
You're the one who broke my heart
When I met you boy, you were as sweet as cherry pie
That smiling eye you were as wild as Friday night
I should have known how ever hard you try
Changed come and strangle it
It was bound to die
You were sweet as cherry pie
Wild as Friday night
Sweet as cherry pie
Wild as Friday night
Gotta find out what I meant to you
You're the one who broke my heart in two
Gotta find out what I meant to you, oh boy
Gotta find out what I meant to you
You're the one who broke my heart in two
Where were you just when I needed you?
You gave me your soul for at least a day
Listen boy, there was a time when I wanted you to stay
You'll know the cost, it's you who's gonna pay
(1409617727513)Heaven please send to all mankind,
Understanding and peace of mind.
But, if it's not asking too much
Please send me someone to love.
Show all the world how to get along,
Peace will enter when hate is gone.
But, if it's not asking too much,
(1409617727513)Sally,
You opened out your arms
To all those young men
And girl you had room
For every one of them
You're the only girl on bowery and third
Sure as hell you're the one who cared
So put your hands together for sally
She saved all those young men
Put your hands together for sally
She's the one who cared for them
She's doing our dirty work
She's the only one who cares
Doing our dirty work
Thirsty world one angry day, in New York
Take a look at Dave he was once seventeen
Soot suit and shinny shoes
He ran around town and through his methylated laughter
Most of his memories drowned
