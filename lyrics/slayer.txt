Trapped in purgatory
A lifeless object, alive
Awaiting reprisal
Death will be their acquittance
The sky is turning red
Return to power draws near
(1409617727513)Auschwitz, the meaning of pain
The way that I want you to die
Slow death, immense decay
Showers that cleanse you of your life
Forced in like cattle, you run
Stripped of your life's worth
Human mice, for the Angel of Death
Four hundred thousand more to die
Angel of Death
Monarch to the kingdom of the dead
Sadistic, surgeon of demise
Sadist of the noblest blood
Destroying without mercy
To benefit the Aryan race
Surgery with no anesthesia
Feel the knife pierce you intensely
(1409617727513)An unforeseen future nestled somewhere in time
Unsuspecting victims no warnings, no signs
Judgment day the second coming arrives
Before you see the light you must die
Forgotten children, Conform a new faith
Avidity and lust controlled by hate
The never ending search for your shattered sanity
Souls of Damnation in their own reality
Chaos rampant
In an age of distrust
Confrontations
Impulsive habitat
(1409617727513)Arrogance, violence, world in disarray
Dealing with insanity every fuckin' day
I hate the life, hate the fame, hate the fuckin' scene
Pissing match of egos, fuck their vanity
Ain't got the time, I don't want anything from you
Feeding on my tolerance is all you fuckin' do
No looking back, no regrets, no apologies
What you get is what you see
Live fast, on high
Repentless, let it ride
(1409617727513)Razors edge outlines the dead, incisions in my head.
Anticipation, the stimulation
To kill the exhilaration
Close your eyes
Look deep in your soul
Step outside yourself
And let your mind go
Frozen eyes stare deep in your mind as you DIE
Close your eyes
And forget your name
Step outside yourself
And let your thoughts drain
As you go insane... go insane!
Innate seed
(1409617727513)Drones since the dawn of time
Compelled to live your sheltered lives
Not once has anyone ever seen
Such a rise of pure hypocrisy
I'll instigate I'll free your mind
I'll show you what I've known all this time
God Hates Us All, God Hates Us All
You know it's true God hates this place
You know it's true he hates this race
Homicide-Suicide
Hate heals, You should try it sometime
Strive for Peace with acts of war
The beauty of death we all adore
I have no faith distracting me
(1409617727513)Cursed
Black magic night
We've been struck down
Down in this Hell
Spells surround me day and night
Stricken by the force of evil light
The force of evil light
Cast
Under his spell
(1409617727513)How I've waited for you to come
I've been here all alone
Now that you've arrived please stay a while
And I promise I won't keep you long
I'll keep you forever
Graze the skin with my finger tips
The brush of dead cold flesh appease the means
Provoking images, delicate features so smooth
A pleasant fragrance in the light of the moon
Dance with the dead in my dreams
Listen to their hallowed screams
The dead have taken my soul
(1409617727513)Propaganda death ensemble
Burial to be
Corpses rotting through the night
In blood laced misery
Scorched earth the policy
The reason for the seige
The pendulum exchange the blade
for strafing air blood raid
Infiltration push reserves
Encircle the front lines
Supreme art of strategy
Playing on the minds
Bombard till submission
Take all to their graves
Indication of triumph
The number that are dead
Sport the war, war support
(1409617727513)Disease spreading death
Entire population dies
Dead before you're born
Massive suicide
Vicious game of fear
It's all extermination now
Poison in your veins
Global genocide
Slaughter governs law
The apocalypse begins
Pain becomes the norm
Seeking homicide
Beware the coming storm
That starts illuminating fires
God is laughing hard
Man has gone insane
World painted blood
No sanctuary
World painted blood
No sanctuary
Tip the human scale
Follow revelations plan
It must come to pass
Secret shadows lie
Blue print haunting dreams
In which manipulation wins
Speak no hidden fears
Religion neutralized
Emerged from the dark
Sadist mercenary ride
Realm of this world
Godless messengers
Sickless, mindless hate
Becoming evolution's cure

(1409617727513)Funeral held for the depression of man
Holds the key to his own death
Entering a tomb of a corpse yet conceived
Tighten the tourniquet around your neck
Sifting away the debris of hated life
Cold touch of death begins to chill your spine
Seeking life beyond your perishment
Repeating words echoing through your mind

(1409617727513)I had you back, but it's no use
False accusations are on the loose
You know what? It makes no sence that you tied your own noose
You never felt the sores decay
Your perfect world is ending today
So what? I wouldn't have it any other way
Is this your paradise? You think you thought this through?
'Cause when you rolled the dice, the house came down on you
Don't care what you do or say, your suicide begins today
Have fun in paradise, this hell is just for you

(1409617727513)Eternal the kiss I breathe
Siphon your blood to me
Feel my wounds of your god
Forever rape mortality
I smell of death
I reek of hate
I will live forever
Lost child, pay the dead
Bleeding screams of silence
In my veins, your eternity
I'll kill you and your dreams tonight
Begin new life
Bleed your death upon me
(1409617727513)Night will come
And I will follow
For my victims, no tomorrow
Make it fast
Your time of sorrow
On his trail
I'll make you follow
Quarters for the criminally insane
The sentence read for life
I must remain
(1409617727513)Murder at your every footstep
A child's toy sudden death
Sniper blazes you through your knees
Falling down can you feel the heat
Burn!
Ambushed by the spray of lead
Count the bullet holes in your head
Offspring sent out to cry
Living mandatory suicide
Suicide
Suicide
Suicide
Suicide
(1409617727513)You made your choice
I'll take my stand
Your life story in my bloodstained hands
Pride in prejudice
Don't give me that power bullshit
Pride in prejudice
One gunshot sets the precedence
Abuse of power, civil unrest
Money in blood is of no significance
Inner rage waiting to ignite
Blood of the innocent unites
I'm right you're wrong
(1409617727513)sU nioJ
Existing on damnation's edge
The priest had never known
To witness such a violent show
Of power overthrown
Angels fighting aimlessly
Still dying by the sword
Our legions killing all in sight
To get the one called lord
The gates of hell lie waiting as you see
There's no price to pay just follow me
I can take your lost soul from the grave
Jesus knows your soul can not be saved
Crucify the so called lord
He soon shall fall to me
Your souls are damned your God has fell
To slave for me eternally
(1409617727513)Lurking in the dismal fog
Hungry for your blood
Seeking harmless victims
Satisfy my needs
Schizophrenic lunatic
Uncontrolled desire
Rape and ravage lady fair
Pledged to die
No apparent motive
Just kill and kill again
Survive my brutal thrashing
(1409617727513)I will run, I will climb, I will soar
I'm undefeated. Oo
Jumping out of my skin, pull the chord
Yeah I believe it
The past, is everything we were
Don't make us who we are
So I'll dream, until I make it real
And all I see is stars
It's not until you fall that you fly
When your dreams come
Alive you're unstoppable
Take a shot, chase the
Sun, find the beautiful
We will glow in the dark
Turning dust to gold
And we'll dream
It possible
Possible
And we'll dream
(1409617727513)I have witnessed your death
I've seen it many times
Your tortured screams
Your decrypted little mind
A father's son with
Pathetic eyes that bleed
Twins in the end
Begin and let the brothers fall!
I will see you burned alive
Screaming for your God
I will watch you die again for him
God won't touch what I've done
He cries upon my feet
A privilege pain
Beneath buried are your dead
On splintered bones I walk
Sifting through the blood
Besieged in fear
Await the coming of the God
I will watch you die again for Him
Blood is raining downward
(1409617727513)Strangulation, Mutilation, Cancer of the brain
Limb dissection, Amputation, From a mind deranged
Asphyxiation, Suffocation, Gasping for air
Explain to me the feeling after sitting in the chair?
Ripping apart
Severing flesh
Gouging eyes
Tearing limb from limb
(1409617727513)You go to the church, you kiss the cross
You will be saved at any cost
You have your own reality
Christianity
You spend your life just kissing ass
A trait that's grown as time has passed
You think the world will end today
You praise the Lord, it's all you say
Jesus saves, listen to you pray
You think you'll see the pearly gates
(1409617727513)Frantic minds are terrified
Life lies in a grave
Silent death rides high above
On the wings of revelation
Multi-death from chemicals
Arrogance has won
Annihilation must be swift
Destroy without destruction
Gods of the throne must be watching from hell
Awaiting the mass genocide
Soldiers defeated by death from a smell
Bodies lie dormant no life
Rising new souls on the land where they fell
Demons not ready to die
Nothing to see where the sleeping souls lie
Chemical warfare
Artificial fucking peace
Line up in a death row
Generals in their slow defeat
Diminish from this hell
(1409617727513)Start with vanity
Arrogance and greed
Panic is my obsession
No one can escape
The thrill is much too great
Despair is my creation
Everything obscene
Emanates from me
Homicide is on the rise
It all begins now
Take your final bow
The camera never lies
Action
torture, misery
Endless suffering
Torment, agony
Captured for eternity
Action
You're the main attraction
Torture, misery
Endless suffering
(1409617727513)Breeding fast in poverty
Infectious driving dormant seed
Inside your carcass start to mate
Left in charge to dominate
Waiting to unfold
Raging uncontrolled
Adapt a potency
Death machine, infest my corpse to be
(1409617727513)Nightmare, The persecution
A child's dream of death
Torment, Ill forgotten
A soul that will never rest
Guidance, It means nothing
In a world of brutal time
Electric, Circuits, Wild
Deep in the infants mind
Silent Scream
Bury the unwanted child
Beaten and torn
Sacrifice the unborn

(1409617727513)Waiting the hour destined to die
Here on the table of hell
A figure in white unknown by man
Approaching the altar of death
High priest awaiting dagger in hand
Spilling the pure virgin blood
Satan's slaughter, Ceremonial death
Answer his every command
Death will come easy just close your eyes
Dream of the friends you'll see
Heavenly failure losing again
Move on to a new form of life

(1409617727513)Awakened I have become
Light now slips away
Manipulate your mind
Darkness is my slave
Taste the sins of Hell
The blood that I so crave
The last thing that you see
Is the hunger in my eyes
Blood sucking creatures of the night
Nocturnal spectre hiding from the light
Cries screaming out every fright
Eagerly awaiting plight
Apparitions from the pits of Hell
Death plagues the streets in which they dwell
Demented lust, the secrets they must keep
Addicted to your blood
At dawn they sleep
Unveil the hidden coffin
Lift the lid of terror
Feel the deadly cold
Freeze you from inside

(1409617727513)Welcome to my world
Involve yourself within my dream
Experience a life
Just like your mind thought not to be
Take a look through time
As past or present words to be
I rule this inferno
Enthroned for eternity
Coils of the serpent unwind
Buried beneath you will find
Deep in the halls of the damned
Spirit in black till the end
Spirits damned to rot
Amidst the brimstone fireballs
Eyes of the dead
Watching from their living walls
Broken glass reflections
(1409617727513)Live by the sword and help to contain
The helpless minds of you all
Die by my hand in pools of blood
Clutch yourself as you fall
Mindless tyranny, forgotten victims
Children slaughtered in vain
Raping the maids, in which they serve
Only the words of the Lord
Die by the sword
Die by the sword
(1409617727513)Oppression is the holy law
In god I distrust
In time his monuments will fall
Like ashes to dust
Is war and greed the master plan?
The bible's where it all began
Its propaganda sells despair
And spreads the virus everywhere
Religion is hate
Religion is fear
Religion is war
Religion is rape
Religion's obscene
Religion's a whore
The pestilence is Jesus Christ
There never was a sacrifice
No man upon the crucifix
Beware the cult of purity
Infectious imbecility
I've made my choice
Six six six
(Solo - Hanneman)
Corruption breeds the pedophiles
Don't pray for the priest
(1409617727513)Stop and think of society's impotence
And the reason behind its incompetence
Faith in God is the vice, bring on the tyranny
Won't be long 'til you find the real irony
Life drags on and we watch it bleed
On controversy and madness we feed
It's a rush you can't deny
A little violence is the ultimate drug
Let's get high
Politician that claims to be the innocent
Sells you peace then defies you with his insolence
(1409617727513)When war cries echoing all begin
never know any other way to fight, just win.
blood on the enemy, with dependencies due
you know that sacrifice starts with you!
Cast the first stone
standing my way
impedance you owe
with blood you will pay!???
your defiance will prove severe
(1409617727513)Blasting our way through the boundaries of Hell
No one can stop us tonight
We take on the world with hatred inside
Mayhem the reason we fight
Surviving the slaughters and killing we've lost
Then we return from the dead
Attacking once more now with twice as much strength
We conquer then move on ahead

(1409617727513)Through the night we rise in pairs
Lords at night we ride
From the depths of Hell's domain
Reborn to reign this night
Roam throughout the endless wars
Hold high his name we must
Warriors from the gates of Hell
In Lord Satan we trust
Stalking the night can't you feel I'm near
Watching each step that you take
I take lives and show all no mercy this night
Attack those not knowing my force ("...their fate")
(1409617727513)Peaceful confrontation meet war machine
Seizing all civil liberties
Honest ballotation among banshee
Spilling blood throughout humanity
You cannot hide the face of death
Oppression ruled by bloodshed
No disguise can deface evil
The massacre of innocent people

(1409617727513)You need to take a closer look at me
Cause I was born to be the thorn in your side
No matter what you think you're gonna see
You never wanted this barrage of fucking pride
You don't want none of me
You've got a fucking catheter in your brain
Pissing your common sense away
When you draw first blood you can't stop this fight
For my own peace of mind - I'm going to
Tear your fucking eyes out
Rip your fucking flesh off
Beat you till you're just a fucking lifeless carcass
Fuck you and your progress
Watch me fucking regress
You were made to take the fall - now you're nothing
Payback's a bitch motherfucker
You only live to be a parasite
Your life must suck when nothing's going your way
(1409617727513)You can never truly see
Inside the ones you know
Until you've found them near
The edge of self-control
All I hear are lies
You're lying to yourself
And everything is out of control
You're just a fuckin' slave of discontent
I'm sick of watching you dig this hole
Time waits - for no one
Won't stop - It can't be outrun
You know - That pain in your head
Won't stop 'til the desperation ends
You've found yourself chasing death
Oblivious until the end
You'll never stop chasing death

(1409617727513)High velocity bullet at close range
Can damage the mind
Shattering the skull shredding the brain
Severing the spine
Bury a round of lead in the chest
It's quite an impression
Imagine the innards of your soul
The infliction
Instinctive regression
With intent to kill
No regard of human life
Or the blood spilled

(1409617727513)Come walk with me through endless time
See what has been and what the future sees
Share the wisdom of the old world that has passed
Step in a life that's yet to be born
You spill the blood
Eternal soul

(1409617727513)time melts away in this living inferno
trapped by a cause that i once understood.
feeling a sickness building inside of me
who will i really have to answer to.
March on through the rivers of red.
souls drift, they fill the air.
forced to fight, behind
the crooked cross.
do only what is expected of me
(1409617727513)Convicted witch my life will end
At midnight on the stake
My dedicated life was spent
To insubordinate
Secured by lock inside a cell
Imprisoned for no crime
The shackles will be useless
When your life is out of time
Incantation spell gone by
I will see life again
My deals will made eternally
I signed the book of red
My rage will be unleashed again
Burning the next morn
Death means nothing, there is no end
I will be reborn

(1409617727513)Gun down cold on a raw deal
Home turf my battlefield
In no ones way caught in a crossfire
Stray bullets can kill
Expendable youths fighting for possession
Having control of principle obsession
Rivalry and retribution death the only solution

(1409617727513)Cascaded darkness
Walls close in on me
Nailed shut but my eyes still see
Severe anguish as my body evolves
The pain of life after death it resolves
Emptiness in twilight's rebirth
The faint sounds of shoveled earth
Madness growing as your mind dissolves
Merely secret in my dreams
Night grows cold, twilight's near
On the edge of madness the wounds are sheared
Forms of hanging, flesh shredded carcass
No spared breath
Imprisoned in a shell, ready to explode
Dead soul
(1409617727513)You know the feeling
When adrenaline takes control
Can't beat the rush
That leaves a suicidal hold
Instinct spares no one
Destroying the human heart
The taste of blood
Can rip your soul apart
Devils that drive us
Do not discriminate
A state of mind
That becomes the ultimate end
Action reaction
Blood line is not immune
To the depth of human nature
(1409617727513)On your back look on to me
You'll see genocide
Face from death more than insane
Profane pleading cries
Watch you die inside watch you die
God send death end misery
Preach no love of ministry
Pray for sin a shattered faith
Down on your knees
Your screaming out to die
Death is over due
Nothing can save you
A morbid symphony
Hearing you lie there screaming
Taking life from you
Is all I wanna do
Desire so deranged
(1409617727513)Initiate blood purge
Coalition in massacre
Mechanized high tech
Whole sale death in effect
Mutually assured
Destruction will occur
Genocide revised
Same pain through diverse eyes
Can't stop the warring factions
Hostile from the start
Always war always
Ending bitter peace
Not the last third war
Blood spills for evermore
Patriot hard line
(1409617727513)A soldier's heart
Reflecting back at me
I keep seeing mutilated faces
Even in my dreams
Distorted images
Flashing rapidly
Psychotically abusing me
Devouring my brain
The eyes of the insane
On a demented campaign
Tortured spirits
Will not let me rest
These thoughts of mutilated faces
Completely possessed
Fragmented images
Flashing rapidly
Psychotically abusing me
Worming through my head
(1409617727513)Screams of terror across the sea
Begging for mercy in their one final plea
Soldiers prepare to fight to the death
Fighting and killing to their very last breath
Blitzkrieg tactics of the German command
Born with the power of God in his hand
He makes his move to conquer the land
Turning all hopes of life to sand
Machine gun fire, blood level higher
Visions of torture and terror to all
Ready for battle awaiting the final command

(1409617727513)
