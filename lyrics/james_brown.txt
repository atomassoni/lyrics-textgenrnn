Ow! Knock out this!
Super highways, coast to coast
Easy to get anywhere
On the transcontinental overload
Just slide behind the wheel
How does it feel
When there's no destination that's too far
And somewhere on the way
You might find out who you are
Living in America
Eye to eye, station to station
Living in America
Hand to hand, across the nation
Living in America
Got to have a celebration
Rock my soul
Smokestack, fatback
Many miles of railroad track
All night radio, keep on runnin' through

Draped in your finest clothes and accessories.
I notice you've been focused on the stress of the week.
But it's Friday tonight.
Spend the night out with me.
Prechorus:
Let's hit the party tonight.
That will be out of sight.
No matter where we decide, it's gon' be on tonight.
You look you're ready and right.
You showed me out of sight.
We're coming home late tonight.
Chorus 1:
We gonna do it right right.
We'll do it right right.
Our hands are sky high.
From left to the right.

We live the good life.
And we'll do it right right.
We'll do it right right.

Hey y'all, John Coltrane yeah he plays the sax
Me, myself I love to max
Up in the studio laying tracks
Burn it on the CD, melt the wax
And now I'm feeling fine
Coz daily music's on my mind
And I feel mellow
When I watch the girl play the cello
Hello to all my fellow peers in here for the quality
Music quality, yeah
That'll be the focus in the top pick of the day
So pass the peas like we used to say
Pass the beats like they used to say
Pass the phunk like they used to say
That's my joint like we used to say
Syncopation the true school way
I don't know what you came to do
I came to drop the funk on you
Depends on that sonic sound
But you know what?
