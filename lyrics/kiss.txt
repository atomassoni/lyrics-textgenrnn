Oh, the heat is on
And my back's against the wall
You know it's tough to be strong
In a world that makes you crawl
I'm never gonna stop
I'm never gonna give up in the fight
'Cause after the battle is done
All you've got left is your pride
I'm gonna talk like I talk
Walk like I walk my way
I'm gonna go where I go
Ain't takin' no my way
Here in the danger zone
It's a jagged edge we climb
But if you take it like stone and stand on your own
You can make the grade in time
Tonight, I want to give it all to you
In the darkness, there's so much I want to do
And tonight, I want to lay it at your feet
Cause girl, I was made for you
And girl, you were made for me
I was made for lovin' you baby
You were made for lovin' me

I feel uptight on a Saturday night
Nine o' clock, the radio's the only light
I hear my song and it pulls me through
Comes on strong, tells me what I got to do
I got to
Get up
Everybody's gonna move their feet
Get down
Everybody's gonna leave their seat
You gotta lose your mind in Detroit Rock City
Get up
Everybody's gonna move their feet
Get down
Everybody's gonna leave their seat
Getting late
I look at you and my blood boils hot
I feel my temperature rise
I want it all, give me what you've got
There's hunger in your eyes
I'm getting closer, baby, hear me breathe
You know the way to give me what I need
Just let me love you and you'll never leave
Feel my heat taking you higher
Burn with me, Heaven's on fire
Paint the sky with desire
Angel, fly, Heaven's on fire
I got a fever raging in my heart
You make me shiver and shake
Baby, don't stop, take it to the top
I gotta tell you what I'm feelin' inside
I could lie to myself, but it's true
There's no denyin' when I look in your eyes
Girl, I'm out of my head over you
And I lived so long believin' all love is blind
But everything about you is tellin' me this time
It's forever
This time I know and there's no doubt in my mind
Forever
Until my life is through
Girl, I'll be lovin' you forever
I hear the echo of a promise I made
I know a thing or two about her
I know she'll only make you cry
She'll let you walk the street beside her
But when she wants she'll pass you by
Everybody says she's lookin' good
And the lady knows it's understood
Strutter
She wears her satins like a lady
Yeah! Yeah!
Don't wanna wait 'til you know me better
Let's just be glad for the time together
Life's such a treat and it's time you taste it
There ain't a reason on earth to waste it
It ain't a crime to be good to yourself
Lick it up, lick it up, oh, oh, oh!
It's only right now
Lick it up, lick it up, oh, oh, oh!
Woo yeah
Lick it up, lick it up, oh, oh, oh!
Come on, come on
Lick it up, lick it up, oh, oh, oh!
Don't need to wait for an invitation
Woh!
Here's a little song for everybody out there!
People try to take my soul away
But I don't hear the rap that they all say
They try to tell us we don't belong
That's all right, we're millions strong
This is my music, it makes me proud
These are my people and this is my crowd
These are crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy nights!
These are crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy nights!
Sometimes days are so hard to survive, oh yeah
A million ways to bury you alive
Beth, I hear you calling
But I can't come home right now
Me and the boys are playing
And we just can't find the sound
Just a few more hours
And I'll be right home to you
I think I hear them calling
Hey hey hey hey yeah
Hey hey hey hey yeah
Hey hey hey hey yeah
Hey hey hey hey yeah
Stand up, you don't have to be afraid
Get down, love is like a hurricane
Street boy, no I never could be tamed
Better believe it
Guilty 'till I'm proven innocent
Whiplash, heavy metal accident
Rock on, I wanna be president
Cause I love it
Loud, I wanna hear it loud
Right between the eyes
Loud, I wanna hear it loud
Don't want no compromise
Turn it up, hungry for the medicine
Two fisted 'till the very end
No more treated like aliens
We're not gonna take it
No lies, no more alibis
Turn it up, got me hypnotized
Rock on, won't be tranquilized
Cause I love it
Loud, I wanna hear it loud
I really love you, baby
I love what you've got
Let's get together, we can get hot
No more tomorrow, baby, time is today
Girl, I can make you feel okay
No place for hidin', baby, no place to run
You pull the trigger of my
Love gun

Love gun


You are not alone and how long can you run?
It's much to late if you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone
Once upon a time you were a child but that was yesterday
Believed that magic in your heart would never fade away
But hold your head up high and let your spirits fly
Keep hope alive, yes deep inside and your dreams will never die
We are one
Everywhere I go, everyone I see
And I see my face looking back at me
We are one
Everything I know, what I know is true
Everyone of us is inside of you
We are one
We are one
Ohh, take a breath, close your eyes, you're on the road again
And then you realize they've brought you back to life again
Something's never change but if you fantasize
You'll feel it deep inside yourself and then you'll realize
When you feel it coming, when you hear the sound
You'll always laugh when you wanna cry
And that you'll know it deep inside
Mmmm, yeah
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Tonight I want to give it all to you
In the darkness
There's so much I want to do
And tonight I want to lay it at your feet
'Cause girl, I was made for you
And girl, you were made for me
I was made for lovin' you baby
You were made for lovin' me
And I can't get enough of you baby
Can you get enough of me?
Tonight I wanna see it in your eyes
Tried to say I'm sorry
I didn't mean to break your heart
And find you waitin' up by the light of day
There's a lot I wanna tell you
But I don't know where to start
And I don't know what I'd do if you walked away
Ooh, baby, I tried to make it
I just got lost along the way
But every time I look at you
No matter what I'm goin' through
It's easy to see
And every time I hold you
The things I never told you
Seem to come easily
'Cause you're everything to me

God gave rock and roll to you,
Gave rock and roll to you
Put it in the soul of everyone
Do you know what you want?
You don't know for sure
You don't feel right, you can't find a cure
And you're gettin' less than what you're lookin' for
You don't have money or a fancy car
And you're tired of wishin' on a falling star
You gotta put your faith in a loud guitar
God gave rock and roll to you,
Gave rock and roll to you
Gave rock and roll to everyone 
God gave rock and roll to you,
Gave rock and roll to you
Put it in the soul of everyone
You tell me that you're leaving
And I'm trying to understand
I had myself believing
I could take it like a man
But if you gotta go, then you gotta know
That's killing me
And all the things I never seem to show
I gotta make you see
Girl it's been so long 
Tell me how could it be
One of us knows the two of us don't belong
In each others company
It hurts so much inside, you're telling me goodbye
You wanna be free
And knowin' that you're gone and leavin' me behind
I gotta make you see
I've been up and down, I've been all around
I was mystified, almost terrified
But late at night I still hear you
Call my name
I've been on my own, I've been all alone
I was hypnotized, I felt paralyzed
But late at night I still want you
Just the same
I've been a gambler, but I'm nobody's fool
And I sure know something,
Sure know something
You showed me things they never taught me in school
And I sure know something,
Sure know something
No one can make me feel the way that you do
And I sure know something, aha
I was seventeen, you were just a dream
Get up
And get your grandma outta here
Pick up
Old Jim is workin' hard this year
And baby
Do the things he says to do
Baby, if you're feeling good
And baby, if you're feeling nice
You know your man is workin' hard
If never I met you
I'd never have seen you cry
If not for our first Hello
We'd never have to say goodbye
If never I held you
My feelin's would never show
It's time I start walkin'
But there's so much you'll never know
I keep telling you Hard Luck Woman
You ain't a Hard Luck Woman
Rags, the sailor's only daughter
A child of the water
Too proud to be a queen
Out on the street for a living
Picture's only begun
Got you under their thumb
Hit it
Out on the streets for a living
Picture's only begun
Your day is sorrow and madness
Got you under their thumb
Well, the night's begun and you want some fun
Do you think you're gonna find it?

You got to treat yourself like number one
Do you need to be reminded?

It doesn't matter what you do or say
Just forget the things that you've been told
We can't do it any other way
Everybody's got to rock and roll, oh oh
Shout it, shout it, shout it out loud
Shout it, shout it, shout it out loud

Alright! C'mon!
My heater's broke. I'm so tired
I need some fuel to build a fire
The girl next door, her lights are out, yeah
The landlord's gone, I'm down and out
Ooh, it's cold gin time again
You know it always wins
Cold gin time again
I feel up tight on a Saturday night
Nine o'clock, the radio's the only light
I hear my song and it pulls me through
Comes on strong, tells me what I gotta do
I got to
Everybody's gonna move their feet
Everybody's gonna leave their seat
You gotta lose your mind in Detroit Rock City
Everybody's gonna move their feet
Everybody's gonna leave their seat
Getting late, I just can't wait
You've got something about you
You've got something I need
Daughter of Aphrodite
Hear my words and take heed
I was born on Olympus
To my father a son
I was raised by the demons
Trained to reign as the one
God of thunder and rock and roll
The spell you're under
Hmm, yeah
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Tonight I want to give it all to you
In the darkness
There's so much I want to do
And tonight I want to lay it at your feet
'Cause girl, I was made for you
And girl, you were made for me
I was made for lovin' you baby
You were made for lovin' me
And I can't get enough of you baby
Can you get enough of me
Tonight I want to see it in your eyes
Feel the magic
Your lightning's all I need
My satisfaction grows
You make me feel at ease
You even make me glow
Don't cut the power on me
I'm feelin' low, so get me high
Shock me, make me feel better
Shock me, put on your black leather
Shock me, we can come together
And baby, if you do what you've been told
You need my love, baby, oh so bad
You're not the only one I've ever had
And if I say I want to set you free
Don't you know you'll be in misery
They call me 
They call me Dr. Love 
I've got the cure you're thinking of 
And even though I'm full of sin
In the end, you'll let me in
You'll let me through, there's nothing you can do
You need my loving, don't you know it's true
So answer, please, get on your knees
There are no bills, there are no fees
Baby, I know what your problem is
The first step of the cure is a kiss
Out of love, there's nobody around
All I hear is the sound of a broken heart
Out of time, no more waitin' for you
Now the hurtin's through and a new day starts
And I feel a change in my life
I sailed into dark and endless nights
And made it alive
Everybody's got a reason to live, baby
Everybody's got a dream and a hunger inside
Everybody's got a reason to live
But it can't be your love
Out of touch with myself for so long
I just can't pretend no more, I keep runnin' out of lies
Lovin' you is killin' me inside
Every time I find the words to end it
Something in your eyes won't let it
Shandi, tonight must last us forever
Forever we say good night and go home
But you know me very well and I know you
You really like my limousine
You like the way the wheels roll
You like my seven inch leather heels
And goin' to all of the shows, but
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Really love me
You like the credit cards and private planes
Money can really take you far
You like the hotels and fancy clothes
And the sound of electric guitars, but
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
I mean like do you
Really love me
You really like rock n' roll
All of the fame and the masquerade
You like the concerts and studios
And all the money, honey, that I make, but
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Really love me
Your backstage pass and black sunglasses
Make you look just like a queen
Even the fans, they know your face
From all of the magazines, but
Do you love me?

God gave rock and roll to you
Gave rock and roll to you
Put it in the soul of everyone
Do you know what you want?
You don't know for sure
You don't feel right, you can't find a cure
And you're gettin'
Less than what you're lookin' for
You don't have money or a fancy car
And you're tired of wishin' on a falling star
You gotta put your faith in a loud guitar
God gave rock and roll to you
Gave rock and roll to you
Gave rock and roll to everyone 
God gave rock and roll to you
Gave rock and roll to you
Put it in the soul of everyone
"Now listen"
If you wanna be a singer, or play guitar
Man, you gotta sweat or you won't get far
'Cause it's never too late to work nine-to-five
You can take a stand, or you can compromise
You can work real hard or just fantasize
Lemme tell ya my story
I got a man-sized predicament
And it's a big one
Goes like this, yeah
My my, ow, yeah!
Never had confession
Never had a home
Never had no worry
Until I met Domino
Ain't the virgin Mary
Love her, I confess
Got my hesitations
'Cause she kisses like the kiss of death
Loves lots of money
Back's against the wall
Searching in the darkness
Running from the day
Hiding from tomorrow
Nothing left to say
Victims of the moment
Future deep in doubt
Living in a whisper
Until we start to shout
Ooh, we're creatures of the night
Ooo, we're creatures of the night
Yeah!
Hello!
Here I am, here we are, we are one
I've been waiting for this night to come
Get up!
Now it's time for me to take my place
The make-up runnin' down my face
We're exiled from the human race
You're in the psy-
You're in the psycho circus
You're in the psy-
You're in the psycho circus
And I say welcome to the show
I've been waiting here to be your guide
So come
I read your mind like an open book
You lost the fire in your eyes
You turn to me with a different look
And then it's raining, looks like it's raining
Oh no, tears are falling
Oh no, tears are falling
Oh no, tears are falling
Something is wrong as I hold you near
Somebody else holds your heart, yeah
Wanna bite the hand that feeds me
Wanna turn the tides
Set the demons free and watch 'em fly
Strike down the one who leads me
I'm gonna take his place
Gonna vindicate the human race
Better watch out
'Cause I'm a war machine
Better watch out
'Cause I'm a war machine, yeah
Is it my fortune or my fame
Is it my money or my name
Is it my personality
Or just my sexuality, yeah, yeah
What is my charisma
What is my charisma, yeah
Is it my body or my brain
Do I drive you insane, ha
Is it the power of my touch
Do you need me too much, too much, too much
What is my charisma, what is my, what is my
What is my charisma
Wherever you are, that's where I'm gonna be
No matter how far, you'll never be that far from me
Some how I would find you, move heaven and earth to your side
Oh I'd walk, this world to walk, beside you
No mountain could ever stand between us
No ocean could ever be that wide
No river too deep to keep your love from me I swear it's the truth
Nothing Can Keep Me From You
There's no race I would not go to
No distance would ever be too far
To keep me away I'd always find a way
To show you it's true
Nothing Can Keep Me From You
Nothing Can Keep Me From You

In the morning I raise my head
And I'm thinkin' of days gone by
And the thing I want out of life is
I want you, I want you
I want you, I want you
You can run, you can hide
But you never get away
You can lie and deny
But you know you're gonna pay
You never loved, you never thought you could
Treat you right, girl, you know I would
You can fight but tonight
