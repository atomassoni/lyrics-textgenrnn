Load up on guns, bring your friends
It's fun to lose and to pretend
She's over-bored and self-assured
Oh no, I know a dirty word
Hello, hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello, how low?
Hello, hello, hello, how low?
Hello, hello, hello
With the lights out it's less dangerous
Here we are now, entertain us
I feel stupid and contagious
Here we are now, entertain us
A mulatto, an albino
A mosquito, my libido, yeah
I'm worse at what I do best
Come as you are, as you were
As I want you to be
As a friend, as a friend
As an old enemy
Take your time, hurry up
Choice is yours, don't be late
Take a rest as a friend
As an old memoria
Memoria
Memoria
Memoria
She eyes me like a Pisces when I am weak
I've been locked inside your heart-shaped box for weeks
I've been drawn into your magnet tar pit trap
I wish I could eat your cancer when you turn black
Hey! Wait!
I've got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice
Hey! Wait!
I've got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice
Hey! Wait!
I've got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice
Your advice
Meat-eating orchids forgive no one just yet
I'm so happy 'cause today I found my friends
They're in my head
I'm so ugly, that's okay, 'cause so are you
Broke our mirrors
Sunday morning is everyday, for all I care
And I'm not scared
Light my candles in a daze
'Cause I've found God
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm so lonely, that's okay, I shaved my head
And I'm not sad
And just maybe I'm to blame for all I've heard
But I'm not sure
I'm so excited, I can't wait to meet you there
And I don't care
We passed upon the stair
We spoke of was and when
Although I wasn't there
He said I was his friend
Which came as a surprise
I spoke into his eyes
I thought you died alone
A long long time ago
Oh no, not me
We never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world
I laughed and shook hand
And made my way back home
I need an easy friend
I do with an ear to lend
I do think you fit this shoe
I do but you have a clue
I'll take advantage while
You hang me out to dry
But I can't see you every night
Free
I do
I'm standing in your line
What else should I be?
All apologies
What else could I say?
Everyone is gay
What else could I write?
I don't have the right
What else should I be?
All apologies
In the sun
In the sun I feel as one
In the sun
In the sun
Married
Buried
I wish I was like you
Easily amused
Rape me
Rape me, my friend
Rape me
Rape me again
I'm not the only one
I'm not the only one
I'm not the only one
I'm not the only one
Hate me
Do it, and do it again
Waste me
Rape me, my friend

Sell the kids for food
Weather changes moods
Spring is here again
Reproductive glands
He's the one
Who likes all our pretty songs
And he
Likes to sing along
And he
Likes to shoot his gun
But he
Knows not what it means
Knows not what it means when I say
He's the one
Who likes all our pretty songs
And he
Likes to sing along
And he
Likes to shoot his gun
But he
Knows not what it means
Knows not what it means
Polly wants a cracker
I think I should get off her first
I think she wants some water
To put out the blow torch
Isn't me, have a seed
Let me clip your dirty wings
Let me take a ride, cut yourself
Want some help, please myself
Got some rope, you have been told
Promise you, I have been true
Let me take a ride, cut yourself
Want some help, please myself

I'm not like them but I can pretend
The sun is gone but I have a light
The day is done but I'm having fun
I think I'm dumb or maybe I'm just happy
I think I'm just happy
I think I'm just happy
I think I'm just happy
My heart is broke but I have some glue
Help me inhale and mend it with you
We'll float around and hang out on clouds
Then we'll come down and have a hangover
We'll have a hangover
We'll have a hangover
My girl, my girl
Don't lie to me
Tell me, where did you sleep last night?
In the pines, in the pines
Where the sun don't ever shine
I would shiver the whole night through
My girl, my girl, where will you go?
I'm going where the cold wind blows
In the pines, in the pines
Where the sun don't ever shine
I would shiver the whole night through
Her husband was a hard working man
Underneath the bridge
Tarp has sprung a leak
And the animals I've trapped
Have all become my pets
And I'm living off of grass
And the drippings from my ceiling
It's okay to eat fish
Cause they don't have any feelings
Something in the way
Mmm-mmm
Something in the way, yeah
Mmm-mmm
Something in the way
Mmm-mmm
Something in the way, yeah
Where do bad folks go when they die?
They don't go to heaven where the angels fly
They go to the lake of fire and fry
Won't see them again till the fourth of July
I knew a lady who came from Duluth
She got bit by a dog with a rabid tooth
She went to her grave just a little too soon
I don't care, I don't care, I don't care, I don't care, I don't care
Care if it's old
I don't mind, I don't mind, I don't mind, I don't mind, mind
Don't have a mind
Get away, get away, get away, get away, away
Away from your home
I'm afraid, I'm afraid, I'm afraid, I'm afraid
Afraid ghost
Even if you have
Even if you need
I don't mean to stare
We don't have to breed
We could plant a house
We could build a tree
I don't even care
We could have all three
She said, she said
She said, she said
I will never bother you
I will never promise to
I will never follow you
I will never bother you
Never speak a word again
I will crawl away for good
I will move away from here
You won't be afraid of fear
No thought was put into this
I always knew it would come to this
Things have never been so swell
I have never failed to fail
Pain
Pain
Pain
You know you're right
You know you're right
You know you're right
Monkey see, monkey do
I don't know why
Rather be dead than cool
I don't know why
Every line ends in rhyme
I don't know why
Less is more, love is blind
I don't know why
Stay, stay away
Stay away
Stay away
Give an inch, take a smile
I don't know why
Fashion shits, fashion styles
I don't know why
Throw it out and keep it in
I don't know why
Have to have poison skin
One baby to another says 'I'm lucky to have met you'
I don't care what you think unless it is about me
It is now my duty to completely drain you
I travel through a tube and end up in your infection
Chew your meat for you
Pass it back and forth
In a passionate kiss
From my mouth to yours
I like you

I'm on my time with everyone
I have very bad posture
Sit and drink Pennyroyal Tea
Distill the life that's inside of me
Sit and drink Pennyroyal Tea
I'm anemic Royalty
I'll start this off without any words
I got so high that I scratched till I bled
I love myself better than you
I know it's wrong so what should I do?
The finest day that I ever had
Was when I learned to cry on command
I love myself better than you
I know it's wrong so what should I do?
I'm on a plain
I can't complain
I'm on a plain
My mother died every night
Come on, people now
Smile on your brother and everybody get together
Try to love one another right now
When I was an alien, cultures weren't opinions
Gotta find a way, to find a way, when I'm there
Gotta find a way, a better way, I'd better wait

Sell the kids for food
Weather changes moods
Spring is here again
Reproductive glands
He's the one
Who likes all our pretty songs
And he
Likes to sing along
And he
Likes to shoot his gun
But he
Knows not what it means
Knows not what it means
When I say
He's the one
Who likes all our pretty songs
And he
Likes to sing along
And he
Likes to shoot his gun
But he
Knows not what it means
Knows not what it means
When I say 'yeah'
Many a hand has scaled the grand old face of the plateau
Some belong to strangers and some to folks you know
Holy ghosts and talk show hosts are planted in the sand
To beautify the foothills and shake the many hands
Nothing on the top but a bucket and a mop
And an illustrated book about birds
See a lot up there but don't be scared
Jesus, don't want me for a sunbeam
Sunbeams are not made like me
Don't expect me to cry
For all the reasons you had to die
Don't ever ask your love of me
Don't expect me to cry
Don't expect me to lie
Don't expect me to die for thee
Jesus, don't want me for a sunbeam
Sunbeams are not made like me
Come on over, and do the twist
Over-do it, and have a fit
Love you so much, it makes me sick
Come on over, and do the twist
Beat me outta me
Beat me outta me
Beat me outta me
Beat me outta me
Beat me outta me
Beat me outta me
Beat me outta me
Truth covered in security
I can't let you smother me
I'd like to, but it couldn't work
Trading off and taking turns
I don't regret a thing
And I've got this friend, you see
Who makes me feel
And I wanted more
Than I could steal
I'll arrest myself
And wear a shield
I'll go out of my way
To prove I still
Smell her on you
Don't tell me what I wanna hear
Afraid of never knowning fear
Experience anything you need
It's so relieving
To know that you're leaving
As soon as you get paid
It's so relaxing
To hear that you're asking
Wherever you get your way
It's so soothing
To know that you'll sue me
This is starting to sound the same
I miss the comfort in being sad
I miss the comfort in being sad
I miss the comfort in being sad

Would you believe me when I tell you
You are the queen of my heart
Please don't deceive me when I hurt you
Just ain't the way it seems
Can you feel my love buzz?
Silence
Here I am
Here I am
Silent
Bright and clear
It's what I am
I have
Died
Mama, mama, mama, mama
I need an easy friend
I do with an ear to lend
I do think you fit this shoe
I do but you have a clue
I'll take advantage while
You hang me out to dry
But I can't see you every night free
I do
I'm standing in your line
Teenage angst has paid off well
Now I'm bored and old
Self-appointed judges judge
More than they have sold
If she floats then she is not
A witch like we had thought
A down payment on another
One at Salem's lot
Serve the servants, oh no
Serve the servants, oh no
Serve the servants, oh no
If I had to lose a mile
If I had to touch feelings
I would lose my soul
The way I do
I don't have to think
I only have to do it
The results are always perfect
But that's old news
Would you like to hear my voice?
Sprinkled with emotion
Invented at your birth
I can't see the end of me
I am my own parasite
I don't need a host to live
We feed off of each other
We can share our endorphins
Doll steak
Test meat
Look on the bright side, suicide
Lost eyesight, I'm on your side
Angel left wing, right wing, broken wing

We passed upon the stair
We spoke of was and when
Although, I wasn't there
He said I was his friend
Which came as a surprise
I spoke into his eyes
I thought you died alone
A long, long time ago
Oh, no, not me
Use just once and destroy
Invasion of our piracy
Afterbirth of a nation
Starve without your skeleton key
I love you for what I am not
I do not want what I have got
A blanket acne'ed with cigarette burns
Speak at once while taking turns
What is wrong with me?
What is wrong with me?
What is what I need?
I'm gonna do with what you think
If you ever think at all
Bipolar opposites attract
Would you believe me when I tell you
You are the queen of my heart
Please don't deceive me when I hurt you
Just ain't the way it seems
Can you feel my love buzz?
I'm buried up to my neck in
Contradictonary flies
I'll take pride as the king of illiterature
I'm very ape and very nice
If you ever need anything, please don't
Hesitate to ask someone else first
I'm too busy acting like I'm not naive
I've seen it all, I was here first

Mom and dad went to a show
They dropped me off at grandpa Joe's
I kicked and screamed
Said "Please, don't go!"
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Had to eat my dinner there
Mashed potatoes and stuff like that
I couldn't chew my meat too good
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Portray sincerity act out of loyalty
Defend your free country wish away pain
Hand out lobotomies to save little familys
Surrealistic fantasy bland boring plain
Holy now in restitution
Won't you believe it? It's just my luck
Won't you believe it? It's just my luck
Won't you believe it? It's just my luck
Won't you believe it? It's just my luck
No recess
No recess
No recess
Won't you believe it? It's just my luck
Won't you believe it? It's just my luck
Won't you believe it? It's just my luck
Like most babies smell like butter
His smell smelled like no other
He was born scentless and senseless
He was born a scentless apprentice
Away
Go away, go away

This is out of our reach
This is out of our reach
This is out of our reach and it's grown
This is getting to be
This is getting to be
This is getting to be drone
I'm a negative creep
I'm a negative creep
I'm a negative creep and I'm stoned
I'm a negative creep
I'm a negative creep
I'm a negative creep and I'am
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more
And if you wouldn't mind I would like to blew
And if you wouldn't mind I would like to blew
And if you wouldn't care I would like to leave
And if you wouldn't mind I would like to breathe
Is there another reason for your stain
Could you believe who we knew was stress or strain?
Here is another word that rhymes with shame
And if you wouldn't mind I would like to blew
He's there in case I won it all
He's scared 'cause I want
He's scared in case I want it all
He's scared 'cause I want
All in all the clock is slow
Six colour pictures all in a row
Of a marigold

She should've stayed away from friends
She should've had more time to spend
She should've died when she was born
She should've worn the crown of thorns
She should have been a son
She should have been a son
She should have been a son
She should have been a son
She should've stood out in a crowd
This is out of our reach
This is out of our reach
This is out of our reach and it's grown
This is getting to be
This is getting to be
This is getting to be drone
I'm a negative creep
I'm a negative creep
I'm a negative creep and I'm stoned
I'm a negative creep
I'm a negative creep
I'm a negative creep and I'am
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more
Come, as you are, as you were, as I want you to be
As a friend, as a friend, as an old enemy
Take your time, hurry up, the choice is yours, don't be late
Take a rest, as a friend, as an old
Memory
Memory
Memory
Memory
Come, doused in mud, soaked in bleach, as I want you to be
As a trend, as a friend, as an old
