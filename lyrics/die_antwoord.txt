"You can't do this, you can't do that"
Yo, fuckin' who said so?

Too hot to handle, too cold to hold
You can't fuck with the chosen one
I-I-I want the knife
I am a alien
No matter how hard I try I don't fit in
Always all on my own,
Sad and lonely
All I want is for someone to play with me
Long ago I was a little girl yeah I was never ever able to fit in
My teachers at school would try to tell me what to do but, yo I would never listen
'Cause I was high all the time, stoned out of my little fucking mind
Misunderstood, lost and confused looking for a sign
All the popular kids at school were always super mean to me and made me cry
I never knew what I should do so I just walked away and said "Fuck off and die"
They said that I'm weird, that I'm ugly, and that I suck
I knew that one day all of those kids would grow up to be boring as fuck
I am a alien
No matter how hard I try I don't fit in
Always all on my own, sad and lonely
Yeah
Ntombazane, ngifuna ukudla nawe

F0k julle, f0k julle, f0k julle naaiers
All my f0kken life i lived a normal f0kken life
Till i went and got myself caught up with the mic
And the beast, coming dope with the rhymes and the flows
A real life trying to cope with the highs and the lows
I got sick and tired of getting treated like a stupid fuck-up
So i fucked my enemies up one time and blew the f0k up
Before it was like 'yo, who's that stupid weirdo?'
Now it's like 'it's a new breed, a rap superhero'
To defeat these devils, Ninja becomes a devil
These god-forsaken wretches will never be on my level
"Wies jy!", f0k you and your whole crew
Yo Hi-Tek, let's fuck around
With some of that feel good gansta shit
I've been rapping for 20 fucking years
A whole lot of fucking blood sweat and tears
Who cares, they don't give a fuck
On the mic I'm taking no prisoners
Check me out, yo, so what if I'm only coming in the game?
So what I'm in it for the cash, money and the fame?
So what if [unverified] is fucking up your brain?
Yo-Landi Visser is the shit up in this bitch
I rap for 20 years, never made a cent
Borrowed money from my mom to pay the rent
Now how I'm gonna get out this mission?
Yolandi shows me two stripes on the fucking piss test
Oh fuck, broke ass Ninja gonna be a daddy
Little baby Ninja gonna need some nappies
Gave it my best shot, never pressed stop
Thank God, die moederfokeen Antwoord went pop
Got a million fucking dollars in the bank
Then I converted all my dollars into rands
That equalled seven million rands in the bank
Not too shitty, fuck you Jimmy, I'm a never give it back
Don't worry Ninja, I'm gonna make you proud
I'm here to work, I'm not here to fuck around

I'm your very special cherry at the top

Been rapping for 20 fucking years
A whole lot of fucking blood sweat and tears

DJ Motherfukin Muggs
Jou ma se poes
Fokken poes
Fokken fat fuck faded naai
Fuck, I'm so faded
So motherfuckin' faded
In the morning, I'll be fresh as fuck
But your carrer still be faded
Fat faded fuck faces hate it
How'd you get so jaded?
Sorry you never made it
Your flash in the pan career faded
Your legacy's overrated, your new shit sounds dated
You no longer famous, kids don't know what your name is
Something crawled up your anus
And died, that's why your face is so fucked up
Sour taste in your mouth
Your bitch call me the greatest
These fat fuck bitches always trip on me
First down for me, they flip on me
I told your boy, "Your bitch needs to chill" 
Can't handle when shit gets real
You are a nut-case, you a two-face
You on a paranoid crusade
Our father
Who art in heaven
Please give me
Something to believe in
I'm either driven or crippled by these demons
Sometimes it feels like the power I wield is a blessing and a curse
And I wanna shine up on my brothers like the sun
But when my light is gone
Change to be ugly
Underneath the streetlight, now,
Waiting for the shit to go down
Oh, no, there's going to be a murder,
Oh god, when the street lights go down
In Africa everything broken
Yeah boy, no money no friends
Just live to fight another day
At night the rats come out to play
In the trash, empty streets where rattys rolling thick as thieves
Take your money if you rich
Take your life and rape your bitch
10pm - no body in the streets just Yolandi and me night walking sipping wine, feeling fine, killing time
Night life wild if you feel like fun, some reason didn't bring my gun
I'm tipsy, giggly and taking selfies,
Taking bribes that made me wealthy
Sense the threat, from behind,
We stop underneath the street light look past these 6 motherfuckers yep,
6 rattys rolling up on us
Underneath the streetlight, now,
Waiting for the shit to go down
There's gunna be blood on the streets,
So much blood on the streets girl,
Even if we're far from home, even if it's snowing
I know that our love is pure, our love will protect us
Even if the world turns against us
I don't care, I don't care
I don't care, I don't care
As long as you're with me
Yeah, haha
It's another one of them old funky Cyprus Hill thangs

Everybody wanna be a gangster

You talk the talk, you better walk the walk, boy

Bucket hat low, yo I keep it low key

Big weed cloud smoking up your whole street
Cypress Soul Assassins on the creep

Sip, sipping light beer, I don't fuck with Olde E
Ease back, you're standing too close homie
What the fuck you want, homes? You don't know me
Never Le Nkemise
Never Le Nkemise
I'm indestructible, gangster number one
Play now, cry later
The harder they come, the harder they fall
Os, you can't stop me
You can try, but you won't survive

I wasn't mad at you but now you mad at me and jealous
Little stink poofy rappers like Anthony and Dennis

Follow my every move like a sea-point moffie
Fuck you and all your arb lyrics

Ninja: Yea, I'll fix it, come here
Sixteen: Mommy can you move away?
Ninja: Come lie in your space,
I'll tell her to go fix it. I'll fix it, lie in the space here
Jealousy makes you nasty
In your face!

Yo-landi Vi$$er, gooi!

Bam!
You don't know who I am
I'm a phenomenon that you can never understand
You don't know where I come from! You don't know where I hang!
I fuck you when I slam with my motherfucking slang
We're coming with the hot stuff drop it like it's warm
Pretty fokken wise hier getattoo op my arm
Ag shame if Yo-landi Vi$$er's fucking with your brain
Don't think about it too much you'll pop a fokken vein
Like b-b-b-boom gimme fucking room!
You're chilling in the fast lane fucking up my zoom
Lekker fokken brain strain keeping up with this shit
All up in the main vain keep it fucking twisted
People think they know me but they don't know shit

All I know is that I'm blowing up like jissus what the fuck? wat?
Jealousy makes you nasty

Mmmh, you smell that?
You know what that smell is
That's right... it's money
Go ahead... rub your dick on that shit
I rub my dick on expensive shit
I rub my dick on expensive shit
It's like a dream come true, I'm living the dream, bru
Rubbing my dick on expensive shit
I rub my dick on expensive shit
I rub my dick on expensive shit
It's like a dream come true, I'm living the dream, bru
Rubbing my dick on expensive shit
Yo, told my daddy I was gonna grow up to be
A superstar rapper making big money
Know what I mean, girl?
But my daddy told me I was living in a dream world
If I said "Yes, dad" I wouldn't have my ZEF swag
Or fly around the whole fucking world getting jet-lag
Getting bitten by the ZEF bug, it's the best drug
If I played it safe I would've never made it ever
Now every day in every way I get a little ZEFfer
No matter what you smoke you'll never get as high as me
It's like a fat "Fuck you!" when these naaiers see
My big billboard up in NYC
Don't you wish your boyfriend was ZEF like me?
I'm the motherfucking greatest, suckers love to hate us
But I make these bitches submissive 'cause I'm a dominator
I'm mad musical, my rhymes are the tightest
That's why I tap beautiful designer vaginas
I rub my dick on expensive shit
I rub my dick on expensive shit
It's like a dream come true, I'm living the dream, bru
Rubbing my dick on expensive shit
I rub my dick on expensive shit
I rub my dick on expensive shit
It's like a dream come true, I'm living the dream, bru
Rubbing my laaney totti op watokal
Black Cats, White Cats
All my Zef Cats, look out
Big dog in the place to be!
Pitbull terrier
I am a pitbull terrier
Pussy, for bad boy
No pussy, sad boy
You're making me crazy
Mal in the skull boy
All work and no play
Make Ninja a dull boy
I'm a animal, love me
I kill you, don't fuck me
Your pitbull, he's crazy
Baby don't hate me
I'd never leave your side, fuck that
Come to the dark side, we have candy

Sure we have coffee, how do you take it?

He drinks it scorching hot like a fucking psycho
He like coffee a lot
And he like his coffee now
Fifty cups of coffee and you know it's on
[Verse 1: Yolandi & ]

Yaa, it's a [?]

Kick you in the mother fuckin poes make you blackout

Sexy boys, fancy boys
Playboys, bad boys

Motherfuckers get buzzed off the spice that I bring
Guess who's got the party jumpin'?
Glow in the dark rave, aura pumping
It's nice and different, yo fuck the the system
My system pumps off it's fucking face
Step into my world nou's jy tuis in paradys
Yo word up to my brother, muis
Pump up your speakers, God se Jesus.
Kyk wies rapping, lekker to the drum
These bad boys like to smack me in the bum
Sea, Sex and Sun
Sea, Sex and Sun
No photos please, I'm having private time
Trying to fuck around with Rhymes
It's cool yo, don't sweat it forget it
Just walk away or whatever, be a fucking bitch
I'm fucking rich, I'm not sort of rich
I get bored of bitches, yeah import a bitch

Of course it is, about the time to freak the sorcerers
What's up baby yo, and away we go
We'll get there fast then we take it slow
I'm a hard mutherfucker with a tender soul
Don't give a fuck but I've got a heart made of gold
I switch off, forget about my enemies
You stare at me, like you're not scared of me
Just absorb the mutherfucken energy
You and me, we can build a memory
And make ya' cum, then I'll make ya' cum some more
Harder than ya' ever fucking cum before
Then just fuck until you can't, fuck until you
Can't fuck no more, then fuck some more
I've seen it all
Face carved out of stone, unreadable
Pretty wise and ugly on the skin
Lovely from within
Baby I love you
And my love is true
You're my everything, I will do anything for you
I would give up all this pretty real shit for you
If you sad, I cry for you
If I have to I'll die for you
Baby I love you
And my love is true
You're my everything, I will do anything for you
I would give up all this pretty real shit for you
If you sad, I cry for you
If I have to I'll die for you
I am the man, the myth
Ninja dominator 
Fuckboy come sneak this bitch
Fuck you, I'm the danger
I do this thing
Called whatever the fuck I want

I'll show you that I can if you tell me that I can't
The fucking thunder pound, with the underground
Crack, dope, banana whippin'
One life, two wives, 'cause I fuck it up when I slam
We don't explain, we don't complain
Sexy boys, fancy boys
Playboys, bad boys
I fink u freeky and I like you a lot Motherfuckers get buzzed off the spice that I bring
Guess who's got the party jumpin'?
Glow in the dark rave, aura pumping
It's nice and different, yo fuck the the system

Yo word up to my brother, muis
Pump up your speakers, God se Jesus.

These bad boys like to smack me in the bum
My crew's blowing up like Chappies bubblegum
Popping in your face, nyaaaa
Yo fuck the rat race my style is rap rave
My crew is kak fresh, so who the fuck cares?
What you fucking think, I'm the type of chick
Who rolls with spif giftige misfits
