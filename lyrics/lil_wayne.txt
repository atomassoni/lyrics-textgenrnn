Take that all the way up
I'm about to take off on these niggas
And I'm codeine dreaming
(and I'm codeine dreaming,and I'm codeine dreaming
And I'm codeine dreaming,and I'm codeine dreaming)
I might take off on you peons and go away to Venus
I'm a star so I put a neutron on my pinkie
I'm moonwalking but my Christian Loubotin's bleeding
I'm smoking moonrocks, shawty, and I'm feeling seated
I might take off on you peons and go away to Venus
I'm a star so I put a neutron on my pinkie
I'm moonwalking but my Christian Loubotin's bleeding
I'm smoking moonrocks, shawty, and I'm feeling seated

I'm in Uranus right now, I think I've seen a demon
I thought I left you back there in the cell or am I dreamin'?
Say I ain't dealing with your dawg, going a different way
I broke up with my redbone, I went the milky way
I'm ridin' in a Wraith feeling like I'm in outer space
Stars on my sunroof, Planet of the Apes
I couldn't wait until they released me, right back on the turf
I took off on you bustas, left you right on planet Earth
I'm feeling Jimmy Neutron, how I blast off on a verse
I know my son gon' like this song so I ain't finna curse
Know he gon' wanna explore the world so I'm gon' show him first
Say we're just distinguished beings, baby, me and you diverse
 
With everything happening today
You dont know whether you're coming or going
But you think that you're on your way
Life lined up on the mirror dont blow it
Look at me when Im talkin to you
You looking at me but I'm lookin through you
I see the blood in your eyes
I see the love in disguise
I see the pain hidden in your pride
I see you're not satisfied
And I dont see nobody else
I see myself I'm looking at the
Mirror on the wall, here we are again
Through my rise and fall
You've been my only friend
You told me that they can understand the man I am
So why are we here talkin' to each other again
I'm sorry, I'm not the most pretty
I'll never ever sing like Whitney
Ooh-ooh-hoo-ooh-hoo
But I still wanna dance with somebody (Tunechi)
So let's let all hearts bleed till they turn to rust
Gonna live it up 'cause it's dangerous
No, I don't want to play the part (amen)
I just wanna dance with somebody (amen)
I just wanna dance with somebody (yeah)
I just wanna dance with somebody
I just wanna dance with somebody
It could be anybody
Tell me, are you that somebody?
Don't matter who you are
Just love me the way I are
I just wanna dance with somebody
I just wanna dance with somebody
I just wanna dance with somebody
But I could never ever dance like Bobby
You can dance, I'mma watch your body
I just wanna stand right behind ya
I just broke up with my ex
Now I'm out here single, I don't really know what's next
But I ain't even trippin', I'mma chill and sit back
And I know they will be coming from the right and the left, left, left
I just broke up with my ex
You're the one I'm feeling as I'm laying on your chest
Good conversation got me holding my breath
And I don't normally say this but goddamn, you're the best, best, best
And if it feels right, promise I don't mind
And if it feels right, promise I'll stay here all night

Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you
Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you
Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you
Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you
As I'm laying on your chest
I'll be out here thinkin' 'bout it, boy, it's just a guess
But something just keeps telling me I'm better than the rest
And I ain't tryna rush you, but goddamn, I'm a mess, mess, mess
And if it feels right, promise I don't mind
I torture you
Take my hand through the flames
I torture you
I'm a slave to your games
I'm just a sucker for pain
I wanna chain you up
I wanna tie you down
I'm just a sucker for pain
I'm a sucker for pain
I got the squad tatted on me from my neck to my ankles
Pressure from the man got us all in rebellion
We gon' go to war, yeah, without failure
Do it for the fam, dog, ten toes down, dog
Love and the loyalty that's what we stand for
Alienated by society, all this pressure give me anxiety
Walk slow through the fire
Like, who gon' try us?
Feeling the world go against us
So we put the world on our shoulder
I torture you
Take my hand through the flames
I torture you
I'm a slave to your games
I'm just a sucker for pain
I wanna chain you up
I wanna tie you down
I'm just a sucker for pain
Head, all night long
You wanted me to love
Mustard on the beat, ho
Girl you should know that I can love you
Better than he can
Girl you should know that I can love you
Better than he can
Pull up on your girl with my roof gone
I'ma pull up on your girl with my jewels on
Pull up on your girl with that heat on
And she ain't know if it's a Dolla or a Dream song
First I beat it from the back, she on top now
She used to wanna leave, but she not now
She used to wanna be with you, but nigga, not now
It's kinda funny how she put herself on lockdown
And now you talkin' that blah-blah-blah
You don't want zero problems, big fella!
Yep!
If one more label try to stop me
It's gon' be some dreadhead niggas in ya lobby
You don't want no problems, want no problems with me, bih!

You don't want no problems, want no problems with me, bih!
You don't want no problems, want no problems with me
Just another day, had to pick up all the mail
There go Chano ridin' through the streets, they be like, "There he go!"
Ooh, I be comin', put the hinges in their hands
Countin' Benjis while we meetin', make 'em shake my other hand
Milly rockin', scoopin' all the blessings out my lap
Bitch I know you tried to cheat, you shoulda never took a nap
Fuck wrong with you? What you was thinkin'?
Fuck you thought it was?

Cut the music up
A lil' louder
Yeah
You had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love, how to love
You had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in the corner tryna put it together
How to love, how to love
For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare, the way you moving your body
Like you never had a love, never had love
When you was just a young'un, your looks were so precious
But now your grown up, so fly it's like a blessing
But you can't have a man look at you for 5 seconds
Without you being insecure
You never credit yourself so when you got older
It's seems like you came back 10 times over
Now you're sitting here in this damn corner
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder
See you had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
I'm the fuckin man, you don't get it do ya?
Type of money everybody acting like they knew ya
Go Uptown, New York City Biiitch
Some Spanish girls love me like I'm Aventura
Tell Uncle Luke I'm out in Miami too
Clubbing hard, Fuckin' women ain't much to do
Wrist blang, got a condo up in Biscayne
Still getting brain from a thang, ain't shit changed
How you feel? how you feel? how you feel?
Twenty five sittin' on 25 mil uhh
I'm in the building and I'm feeling myself
Rest in peace Mac Dre, I'mma do it for the Bay, okay
Getting paid well holla whenever that stop
My team good, we don't really need a mascot
Tell Tune "light one, pass it like a relay"
YMCMB you niggas more YMCA
Me, Freddie, Marley Marl at the cribbo
Shout goes out to Niko, Jay and Chubbo, shout to Gibo
We got Santa Margarita by the liter
She know even if I'm fuckin with her, I don't really need her
Aohhh, That's how you feel man?
That's really how you feel?
Cause the pimpin' ice cold, all these bitches wanna chill
I mean maybe she won't
Then again maybe she will
I can almost guarantee she know the deal,
Real nigga what's up?
Now she want a photo
You already know though
You only live once: that's the motto nigga YOLO and
We bout it every day, every day, every day
Like we sittin' on the bench, nigga we don't really play
M-M-Murda
I don't need no, frauds
I don't need no, drama when you call
I don't need no, fake
Soon as I wake up keep an eye out for the snakes, yeah
'Cause I don't need no, fraud
I don't no, drama when you call
I don't need no, lies
Pick a side, pick a side
I took the price, and lift that bitch up
I took the ice, let me lift my wrist up
I took the price, and lift that bitch up
I took the ice, let me lift my wrist up
Aye yo, throw your wrist-es up, all my bitches up
These niggas is pussier than what? All them dicks is up
All my real niggas down to ride, throw your GSXRs up
I ain't in the projects, but all my bricks is up, rrrr
You can't be Pablo if your work ain't sellin'
What the fuck is this bitch inhalin'?
I would've helped you out that pit you fell in
I am the generous Queen! Ask Ms. Ellen
Tried to drop "Another One", you was itchin' to scrap
You exposed your ghostwriter, now you wish it was scrapped
Heard your pussy on "Yuck," I guess you needed a Pap
What type of bum bitch shoot a friend over a rack?
What type of mother leave her one son over a stack?
Lil Boogie down basic bitch thinkin' she back
Back to back, oh you mean, back to wack?
Young Money! You dig?
Mack, I'm going in
A millionaire, I'm a Young Money millionaire
Tougher than Nigerian hair
My criteria compared to your career just isn't fair
I'm a venereal disease, like a menstrual, bleed
Through the pencil, I leak on the sheet of the tablet in my mind
‘Cause I don't write shit, ‘cause I ain't got time
‘Cause my seconds, minutes, hours go to the almighty dollar
And the almighty power of that ch-cha-cha-chopper
Sister, brother, son, daughter, father; mother-fuck a copper
Got the Maserati dancing on the bridge, pussy poppin'
Tell the coppers: "Ha-ha-ha-ha
You can't catch him, you can't stop him"
I go by them goon rules, if you can't beat 'em then you pop 'em
You can't man 'em then you mop 'em
You can't stand 'em then you drop 'em
You pop 'em ‘cause we pop 'em like Orville Redenbacher
Motherfucker, I'm ill
A million here a million there
I'm on that good kush and alcohol
I got some down bitches I can call
I don't know what I would do without y'all
I'm gon' ball til the day I fall
Yeah, long as my bitches love me (yeah, yeah)
I can give a fuck 'bout no hater
Long as my bitches love me (yeah, yeah)
I can give a fuck 'bout no niggas
Long as these bitches love me
Uh, pussy ass nigga stop hating
Lil Tunechi got that fire
And these ho's love me like Satan, maaaan!
Fuck with me and get bodied
And all she eat is dick
She's on a strict diet, that's my baby
With no makeup she a ten
And she the best with that head
Even better then Karrine
She don't want money
She want the time that we could spend
She said "Cause I really need somebody
So tell me you're that somebody"
Girl, I fuck who I want and fuck who I don't
Got that A1 credit, that's that filet mignon
She said "I never want to make you mad
I just want to make you proud"
I said "Baby just make me cum
Then don't make no sound"
I never fucked Wayne, I never fucked Drake
On my life man, fuck's sake
If I did, I'd minaj wid' him and let 'em eat my ass, like a cupcake
My man full, he just ate
I don't duck nobody, but tape
Yeah, that was a set-up for a punchline on duct tape
Worried 'bout if my butt's fake
Worry 'bout y'all niggas, us straight
These girls are my sons, John and Kate plus eight
When I walk in, sit up straight
I don't give a fuck if I was late
Dinner with my man on a G5, is my idea of an update
Hut-hut one, hut-hut two
Big titties, big butt-too
Fuck with them real niggas, who don't tell niggas what they up to
Had to show bitches where the top is
Ring finger where the rock is
These hoes couldn't test me, even if their name was pop quiz
Bad bitches who I fuck with
Mad bitches, we don't fuck with
I don't fuck with them chickens unless they last name is cutlet
Let it soak in like seasonin'
And tell 'em bitches blow me, Lance Stephenson
Raise every bottle and cup in the sky
Sparks in the air like the Fourth of July
Nothing but bad bitches in here tonight
Oh, if you lame and you know it be quiet
Nothing but real niggas only
Bad bitches only
Rich niggas only
Independent bitches only
Boss niggas only
Thick bitches only
I got my real niggas here by my side, only
I never fucked Nicki cause she got a man
But when that's over then I'm first in line
[Chorus:]
It may not mean nothing to yall
But understand nothing was done for me
So I dont plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever mine, ever mine, ever mine
Im shutting shit down at the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I aint even planning to call
I want this shit forever mine, ever mine, ever mine, ever mine
[Drake]
Last name ever
First name greatest
Like a sprained ankle boy I aint nothing to play with
Started off local but thanks to all the haters
I know G4 pilots on a first name basis
In your city faded off the brown, Nino
She insists she got more class, we know
Swimming in the money come and find me, Nemo
If I was at the club you know I ball, chemo
Drop the mixtape that shit sounded like a album
Who'da thought a country wide tour'd be the outcome
Labels want my name beside the X like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one
Yeah nigga Im about my business
Killing all these rappers you would swear I had a hit list
Everyone who doubted me is asking for forgiveness
If you aint been a part of it at least you got to witness
Bitches
[Chorus]
[Kanye West]
I used to have hood dreams
Big fame, big chains
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
Six-foot, seven-foot, eight-foot bunch
Six, six-foot, seven-foot, eight-foot bunch
Excuse my charisma, vodka with a spritzer
Swagger down pat, call my shit Patricia
Young Money militia and I am the commissioner
You no wan' start Weezy 'cause the F is for Finisher
So misunderstood but what's a world without enigma?
Two bitches at the same time, synchronized swimmers
Got the girl twisted 'cause she open when you twist her
Never met the bitch but I fuck her like I missed her
Life is the bitch and death is her sister
Sleep is the cousin, what a fuckin' family picture
You know Father Time and we all know Mother Nature
It's all in the family but I am of no relation
No matter who's buyin', I'm a celebration
Black and white diamonds, fuck segregation
Fuck that shit, my money up, you niggas just Honey Nut
Young Money runnin' shit and you niggas just runner-ups
I don't feel I done enough, so I'ma keep on doin' this shit
Lil' Tunechi or Young Tuna Fish
Six-foot, seven-foot, eight-foot bunch
Six-foot, seven-foot, eight-foot bunch
Yeah, I'm goin' back in
Okay, I lost my mind, it's somewhere out there stranded
I think you stand under me if you don't understand me
Had my heart broken by this woman named Tammy
But hoes gon' be hoes so I couldn't blame Tammy
Oww! Uh-huh
No homo, Young Moolah baby
I said he's so sweet, make her wanna lick the wrapper
So I let her lick the rapper
She, she, she licked me like a lollipop
She, she licked me like a lollipop
She, she, she licked me like a lollipop
She, she licked me like a lollipop
Shawty want a thug
Bottles in the club
Shawty wanna hump
You know I love to touch ya lovely lady lumps
Shawty wanna thug
Bottles in the club
Shawty wanna hump
You know I love to touch ya lovely lady lumps
Okay, lil mama had a swag like mine
She even wear her hair down her back like mine
I make her feel right when it's wrong like lyin'
Man, she ain't never had a love like mine
But man, I ain't never seen an ass like hers
That pussy in my mouth had me lost for words
So I told her back it up like, "burp, burp"
And made that ass jump like, "jerp, jerp"
And that's when she
She, she, she licked me like a lollipop (oh yeah I like that)
She, she licked me like a lollipop (oh yeah I like that)
She, she, she licked me like a lollipop (I like that)
She, she licked me like a lollipop
Shawty want a thug
Bottles in the club
(You know, uhn, uhn, uhn
You know, uhn, uhn, uhn)
Uh, thinkin' out loud
I must have a quarter million on me right now
Hard to make a song 'bout somethin' other than the money
Two things I'm 'bout is talkin' blunt and staying blunted
Pretty women, are you here? Are you here right now, huh?
We should all disappear right now
Look, you're gettin' all your friends and you're gettin' in the car
And you're comin' to the house, are we clear right now, huh?
You see the fleet of all the new things
Cop cars with the loose change
All white like I move things
Niggas see me rollin' and their mood change
Like a motherfucker
New flow, I got a dozen of 'em
I don't trust you, you are undercover
I could probably make some step-sisters fuck each other (oh)
Talkin' filets with the truffle butter
Fresh sheets and towels, man she gotta love it
Yeah, they all get what they desire from it
What, tell them niggas we ain't hidin' from it
(You know, uhn, uhn, uhn
Hm hm hm hm, oh oh oh oh, yeah
(Mustard on the beat ho)
He felt just like you
His arms, his lips
His promises were just as smooth
His grip, it fit though I'll admit that only you
Could make me feel the way you do
Though you know love is blind
And he just caught my eye
You know me, and honestly I'm better without you
Don't you got me checking on my phone by the hour
Baby, I'm hoping and praying
My knees weak, I'm shaking
'Cause you know that I always needed saving
Now I'm fucking lonely, and you didn't want me
Trying to show me that you didn't own me
But all you do is leave me fucking lonely
Knees on the concrete, cut up and bleeding
For no Goddamn reason
But all you do is leave me fucking lonely
Leave me fucking lonely
Yellow model shit, yellow bottle sipping
Yellow Lamborghini, yellow top missing
Yeah, yeah, that shit look like a toupee
I get what you get in ten years, in two days
Ladies love me, I'm on my cool J
If you get what I get, what would you say?
She wax it all off, Mr. Miyagi
And them suicide doors, hari kari
Look at me now, look at me now
Oh, I'm getting paper
Look at me now, oh look at me now
Yeah, fresh than a motherfucker
Lil nigga bigger than gorilla
'Cause I'm killing every nigga that try to be on my shit
Better cuff your chick if you with her, I can get her
And she accidentally slip and fall on my dick
Oops, I said on my dick
I ain't really mean to say on my dick
But since we talking about my dick
All of you haters say hi to it, I'm done
Ayo Breezy
Let me show you how to keep the dice rolling
When you're doing that thing over there, homie
Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye
Let's go
'Cause I feel like I'm running and I'm feeling like I gotta
Get away, get away, get away
Better know that I don't and I won't ever stop 'cause
You know I gotta win everyday day, go
She didn't really wanna pop me
Young Mula, baby
You thought it was over?
I wasn't born last night
I know these hoes ain't right
But you was blowing up her phone last night
But she ain't have her ringer nor her ring on last night, oh
Nigga, that's that nerve
Why give a bitch your heart when she'd rather have a purse?
Why give a bitch an inch when she'd rather have nine?
You know how the game goes
She be mine by half time, I'm the shit, oh
Nigga, that's that nerve
You all about her, and she all about hers
Birdman Junior in this bitch, no flamingos
And I done did everything, but trust these hoes
(CB fuck with me!)
When a rich nigga want ya
And your nigga can't do nothing for ya
These hoes ain't loyal
These hoes ain't loyal
Yeah, yeah, let me see
Just got rich
Took a broke nigga bitch
I can make a broke bitch rich
But I don't fuck with broke bitches
Got a white girl with some fake titties
I took her to Dubai with me
Eyes closed, smoking marijuana
Rolling up that Bob Marley
I'm a rasta
She wanna do drugs,
Smoke weed, get drunk
She wanna see a nigga trapped
I got ice in my veins, blood in my eyes
Hate in my heart, love in my mind
I seen nights full of pain, days of the same
You keep the sunshine, save me the rain
I search but never find, hurt but never cry
I work and forever try, but I'm cursed so never mind
And it's worse but better times seem further and beyond
The top gets higher, the more that I climb
The spot gets smaller and I get bigger
Tryna get into where I fit in, no room for a nigga
But soon for a nigga it be on motherfucker
'Cause all this bullshit, it made me strong motherfucker
So I pick the world up and imma drop it on your fuckin' head, yeah!
Bitch, imma pick the world up and imma drop it on your fuckin' head
(YEAH) And I could die now rebirth motherfucker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth
Motherfucker I'm gone
Motherfucker I'm gone
Uhhhh!
I know what they don't wanna tell you
Just hope you're heaven sent, and you're hell proof
I walk up in the world and cut the lights off
Love
Love
Love
Don't hurt me
Don't hurt me
No more
Young Money, yeah
Uh, throw dirt on me and grow a wildflower
But it's "fuck the world"
Get a child out her
Yeah, my life a bitch, but y'know nothing about her
Been to hell and back, I can show you vouchers
I'm rolling Sweets, I'm smoking sour
Married to the game but she broke her vows
That's why my bars are full of broken bottles
And my night stands are full of open Bibles
Uh, I think about more than I forget
But I don't go around fire expecting not to sweat
And these niggas know I lay them down, make 'em beg
Bitches try to kick me while I'm down
I'll break your leg
Money outweighing problems on a triple beam
I'm sticking to the script, you niggas skipping scenes
Uh, be good or be good at it
Fucking right I've got my gun, semi-Cartermatic
Yeah, put a dick in their mouth, so I guess it's "fuck what they say"
I'm high as a bitch
Up, up and away
Man, I'll come down in a couple of days
OK, you want me up in a cage, then I'll come out in beast mode
I got this world stuck in the safe, combination is the G-code
It's Weezy motherfucker, blood gang and I'm in bleed mode
All about my dough but I don't even check the peep-hole
So you can keep knocking but won't knock me down
No love lost, no love found
It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now
You kicked me when I was down
But what you say just
Don't hurt me
That's right bitch
Don't hurt me
And I don't need you
No more
Don't want to see you
No more
Ha, bitch you get
No love
You showed me nothing but hate
You ran me into the ground
But what comes around goes around
I don't need you
He said he came from Jamaica
He owned a couple acres
A couple fake visas 'cause he never got his papers
Gave up on love, fucking with them heart breakers
But he was gettin' money with the movers and the shakers
He was mixed with a couple things
Ball like a couple rings
Bricks in the condo and grams to sing sing
Left arm, baby mother tatted
5-year bid up, North on they ratted
Anyway, I felt him, helped him
Put him on lock, seatbelt them
Took him out to Belgium, welcome!
Bitches this pretty, that's seldom
This box better than the box he was held in
I'm Momma Dee in that order
I call him Daddy like daughters
He like it when I get drunk
But I like it when he be sober
That's top of the toppa
I never fuck with beginners
I let him play with my pussy
Then lick it off of his fingers
I'm in the zone
Now tell me how you love it
You know you at the top when only heaven's right above it
We onnn, cause we onnnnn

Flying Hollygrove chicks to my Hollywood shows
And I wanna tell you something that you prolly should know
This that Slumdog Millionaire Bollywood flow
And uhhhh, my real friends never hearin' from me
Fake friends write the wrong answers on the mirror for me
That's why I pick and choose, I don't get shit confused
I got a small circle, I'm not with different crews
We walk the same path, but got on different shoes
Live in the same building, but we got different views
I got a couple cars I never get to use
Don't like my women single, I like my chicks in twos
And these days all the girls is down to roll
I hit the strip club and all them bitches find a pole
Plus I been sippin' so this shit is movin' kinda slow
Just tell my girl to tell her friend that it's time to go
Now tell me how you love it
You know you at the top when only heaven's right above it

Got a verse for anybody wanna talk about the clique
I've been takin' shit light, you don't wanna hear me trip
God damn, do y'all really know who you fuckin' with?
Yeah, I mean you can't blame me for wonderin'
Doesn't matter, could be winter or the summer
On the road, I do One Direction numbers, I don't fuckin' miss
Yeah, Stunna and Mack know
When Wayne was gone for eight months, we put this thing up on our back
And I was snappin' off on every single track though
Collect call from the boss like where we at though
I was like, "Hah, it's our time, nigga"
He left Rikers in a Phantom, that's my nigga
And I've been rockin' with the team, Tha Carter IX
And we YMCMB, waitin' on somebody to try us, nigga
Early in the morning's when I think about you

M-O-E-T
That's what we sippin'

My trap house still tippin'
FaceTime when I'm gone
She gave me dome from the distance
She love to climb on top
She love to walk off limping
Pimps up, hoes down
Legs up or toes down
Why she jock me? Cause she knocked me
And we got trees, so merry-go-round
Gotta know I ate her
She so sweet now and later
I want that all the time, all the time
I make you all mines when it's…
Early in the morning's when I think about you
Bitches want money stacks, I just want my percent
She told me to hit the hole, I used to play running back
You niggas be fumbling, don't you give 'em no gun again
These bitches be flying out, yeah, 'cause money be coming in
Said the money be coming in, the money be coming in
The money be coming in, the money be coming in
See you niggas just run your mouth, yeah
My niggas, we run this shit
The money be coming in, the money be coming in
Look, my bitch is on Tumblr, your bitch need a tummy tuck
Since Jesus and Nazareth, the realest you've come across
I be with killers just coming home
They only hope is me and the Quran
They only wish is for a new chain
But they stuck up in the ankle bracelet
I get the money stacked, see the moon's where it's sunny at
And I move where the realest be
And the quickest, see baby, you gettin' lapped
Yeah, the DMV on the map
That's a city, two states if you can count
I'm as real as I say, I never lie
So whenever I go, know I'm runnin' back
Bitches want money stacks, I just want my percent
Southside
If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you
I don't usually do this but the drink has got me moody
Got me thinking 'bout decisions man
I should've left with Juvey
Got me bustin' with my cutie
I can't trust her nor her booty
Every night, she actin' new school, I am not gon' be a student
I got class, I got trash, I got bills, I got pills
Heard them boys gon' write me off
I hope they also writing they wills
I got beam, I got flash, I got dreams and nightmares past
I'm allergic to the (brrrr) I'm using wings to wipe my ass
Right now I'm high as shit, I'm on a bumble streak
I just got out my bitch, felt like the sunken place
She give me drunken face, she give me highest praise
And when I'm in LA, I'm smoking Kobe Bryant eighths
I watched my father whip the yay up like some mayonnaise
Mom's would come home, they would argue he didn't put away the plates
Taught me how to do my dirty, clean up at the same time
Right now I'm on a couple percs & leaning at the same time
Remix baby, Tunechi!
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now, got me talking about my life
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
Corazón, forever on my knees and what I get I need
Mi corazón, for everything I fight, for every little lie
Mi corazón, forever in your place, forever part of me
Mi corazón, corazón, corazón
Ok, now, I don't mind if the shadow's heavy
'Cause I can make it right only if you let me
Everything you're hiding I know already
When we get slow, you go, I get it
Feeling all alone and I run with it
Now you got a home, got a home let me in
I can make it right, baby, if you admit it
Oooh
(Corazón) 'Cause everybody got a
light, baby, you're the light inside of me
(Corazón) Tell me what I gotta do, baby I'm the light inside of you

Young Money
four
I tell her "now goin' pop that pussy for a real nigga"
I already know that life is deep but I still dig her
Niggas is jealous but really I couldn't care less
I'm in hell's kitchen with an apron and a hair net
Devil on my shoulder, the lord as my witness
So on my Libra scale, I'm weighing sins and forgiveness
What goes around, comes around like a hula hoop
Karma is a bitch? Well just make sure that bitch is beautiful
Life on the edge, I'm dangling my feet
I tried to pay attention but attention paid me
Haters can't see me, nose bleed seats
And today I went shopping and talk is still cheap
I rock to the beat of my drumset
I've been at the top for a while and I ain't jump yet
But I'm Ray Charles to the bullshit
Now jump up on that dick and do a full split
Uh, she just started to pop it for a nigga
And look back and told me "baby, it's real"
And I say I ain't doubt you for a second
I squeeze it and I can tell how it feel
I wish we could take off and go anywhere but here baby you know the deal
But she bad, so maybe she won't
Uh, but shit then again maybe she will
Yeah,
Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin' game right now
She will, yeah
You got something that I believe
I've been waiting for all my
We're blazing high, smoke fill the night
I'm gasoline, you're fire
Oh, you're burnin' me down, burnin' me down
Oh, you're burnin' me down, burnin' me
Light my body up
Light my body up
Light my body up
Like tick tick, tune
Got you lit like tick tick, tune

Light my body up
Like tick tick, tune
Got you lit like tick tick, tune
Young Nino, fuck a bitch in a pea coat

Bun B do, Pimp C, R-PIDO though
I goes deep in that pussy, Dan Marino
She wanna be the one, fuck her to my own single
Break a bitch heart, no future Miss Cleo
Snapback, au-au-automatic reload
Flyer than a fucking beetle, you can't beat ‘em
Vampire fuck up your evening
I pop up and eat lunch, leave you in the cement
Don't believe it, stripe like A-fucking-didas
The gun Selena, give a nigga Bieber fever
Real fucking hot, put it in park
Take a shot, higher than a tube sock
You's a bop, give me top top, as I load the guap
Man these niggas say I'm fly but to her I'm God
I'm faded faded faded
My nigga I'm faded faded faded
My nigga I'm faded faded faded
My nigga I'm faded faded faded
My nigga I'm faded faded faded
My nigga I'm faded faded faded
My nigga I'm faded faded faded
My nigga I'm faded faded faded
And I don't give a fuck
Remix, baby, yeah[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]I meet you at the spot, send the location
I don't do this a lot, special occasion
I know you ain't a thottie, you ain't no basic
I turn your dry spot to an oasis
I kiss the right spots, I know all the places
Oh I lick the right spots, that's an ultimatum
The loud in rotation, cloud 9, floatation
Let the rose petals spread like rotation
I know your ex to blame for your cold nature
Tell him stay in his lane, stop the roadragin'
And now I got you in here makin' those faces
Runnin' 'round the bedroom like four bases, moolah![Chorus: Khalid]Send me your location, let's
Focus on communicating'
Cause I just need the time and place to come through (place to come through)
Send me your location
Let's ride the vibrations
I don't need nothing else but you[Verse 2: Khalid]At times I wonder why I fool with you
But this is new to me, this is new to you
Initially, I didn't wanna fall for you
Gather my attention it was all for you, so don't
Take advantage, don't leave my heart damaged
To understand that things go a little bit better when you plan it...
oh
So won't you[Chorus: Khalid]Send me your location, let's
Focus on communicating'
I'm facing the bottle
For all of my problems
These Instagram models
Are nothing but trouble
She's going away now
I'm going full throttle
All these Instagram models
I said they're nothing but trouble
Uh, when I met her she was out for love
Yeah, I bought her leather and some diamond studs
Damn, when I met her she was molly'd up
Fuck it, I said "Whatever" cause I'm not a judge
No, all my niggas say she's not what's up
Uh, I considered it but not enough
Uh, she just wanted to be popular
Uh, she just wanted ten thousand followers
Oh, she posted, she posted, she posted
They like it, they like it, repost it
She party promoting, she hosting
She posing, legs open, provoking
It got my head smoking
I wasn't born last night
I know this hoes ain't right
But you was blowning up her phone last night
But she ain't have her ring nor her ring on last night, oh
Nigga, that's that nerve
Why give a bitch your heart?
When she rather have a purse
Why give a bitch your inch?
When she rather have nine
You know how the game goes
She be mine by half time, I'm the shit, oh
Nigga, that's that nerve
You all about her, and she all about hers
Birdman Junior in this bitch, no flamingos
And I done did everything but trust these hoes
(CB fuck with me!)
When a rich nigga want you
And your nigga can't do nothing for ya
These hoes ain't loyal
These hoes ain't loyal
Yeah, yeah, let me see
Just got rich
Took a broke nigga's bitch
I can make a broke bitch rich
But I don't fuck with broke bitches
Got a white girl with some fake titties
I took her to the bay with me
Eyes closed smoking marijuana
Rolling up the Bob Marley I'm a rockstar
She wanna do drugs, smoke weed, get drunk
Hey hey hey, na na na
Tell me, what you think we hustle for?
I just wanna buy the world
Do the impossible
Sing it with me now, na na na
What you think we out here working' for?

Do the impossible
Hey hey hey
Bought a Benz for my baddest bitch

Pray for us cause we be in and out that mothafucka
Lord, help us Lord, my bitch is beautiful, Helen of Troy
Just like assume I get ass from the start
I flip the script when they cast for the part

Strength in numbers, my nigga

Like my puzzles got figured
I spoil my kids, they so stubborn, my nigga

I got stopped by a lady cop
Ha ha… she got me thinking I can date a cop
Ha ha… cause her uniform pants are so tight

She said I had the right to remain silent
Now I got her hollering sounding like a siren
Talkin' bout…

And I know she the law and she know I'm the boss

Yo, I just started my sentence like a capital letter
Got bars for years, I hope you send me a letter
Know she'll never be queen, so now she got a vendetta
I ain't talkin' 'bout David when I say I'ma Guetta
Twenty mil' on my off, season of course
Twenty million when you ain't put out no album or tours
Yes, bitch, I'm me
Pretty N-I-C
You get it? Icy
But my name is spelled N-I-C
I feel like we going under
Take me down
I can't help but wonder
You got everything I want and
If you keep on talking
I'ma put it where you want it
Keep up, ain't no need to slow it down
We could get it poppin'
You could love me, love me downtown
You got everything I want now
Let me fill your fantasies
And give you what you dream 'bout
You got something that I believe
People around you should really have nothing to say
Me, I'm just proud of the fact that you've done it your way
And the weekends here started it right, even if you only get part of it right
Live for today, plan for tomorrow, party tonight, party tonight
Dying to meet your girlfriends that you said you might bring
If they're the ones that tell you that you do the right thing
Houston girls, love the way it goes down
Atlanta girls, love the way it goes down
Vegas girls, love the way it goes down
But I gotta say, oh, baby, oh baby, why is this so familiar?
Just met her, already feel like I know the real her
You musta done this before, this can't be your first time
We musta been here before, it's still fresh on my mind
You got that shit that somebody would look for but won't find
You musta done this before, this can't be your first time
They keep telling me don't save you
If I ignore all that advice, then something isn't right
Then who will I complain to?
But the weekend's here, started it right, even if I only get part of it right
Live for today, plan for tomorrow, party tonight, party tonight
You got your guards up, I do too, there's things we might discover
Cause you got a past and I do too, we're perfect for each other
Houston girls, love the way it goes down
Atlanta girls, love the way it goes down
Yeah
I put my shades on.
I live it up like these are my last days
If time is money, I'm an hour past paid
Ughh, gunpowder in my hourglass
Niggas faker than some flour in a powder bag
Yeah, I put it down like my hands hurting
I'm on a natural high, but I land perfect
Some of us are lovers, most of y'all haters
But I put up a wall, and they just wallpaper
So love or hate me, I stay hate-free
They say we learn from mistakes, that's why they mistake me
I got some weight on my shoulders, to me it's like feathers
All hail Weezy, call it bad weather
I stick to the script, I memorize the lines
Cause life is a movie that I've seen too many times
You're on the outside looking in, close the blinds
And they say never say never, but f-ckin nevermind
I've been gone too long
True or false, right or wrong
Hello Weezy, welcome home
Yeah and I'm a blunt blowin'
Polo draws showin'
I don't give a lovely motherf-ck ass nigga
With my money growing, no matter where you going
You don't need a bus pass, for me to bust yo ass nigga
I'ma blunt blowin'
Polo draws showin'
I don't give a lovely motherf-ck ass nigga
It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand, nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever mine, ever mine, ever mine
I shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever mine, ever mine, ever mine, ever mine
Last name ever, first name greatest
Like a sprained ankle, boy I ain't nothing to play with
Started off local, but thanks to all the haters
I know G4 pilots on a first name basis
And your city faded off to brown, Nino
She insists she got mo' class, we know
Swimmin' in the money, come and find me, Nemo
If I was at the club you know I ball, chemo
Drop the mixtape, that shit sounded like an album
Who'd've thought a countrywide tour would be the outcome
Labels want my name beside the X like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one
Yeah nigga, I'm about my business
Killing all these rappers, you would swear I had a hit list
Everybody who doubted me is asking for forgiveness
If you ain't been a part of it, at least you got to witness
Bitches
It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever mine, ever mine, ever mine
I shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever mine, ever mine, ever mine
Hey, ever, ever, Mr. West is in the building
Ain't no question who we're about to kill
I used to have hood dreams, big fame, big chains
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
I went hard all fall like the ball teams
Just so I can make it rain all spring
I got ice in my veins, blood in my eyes
Hate in my heart, love in my mind
I seen nights full of pain, days of the same
You keep the sunshine, save me the rain
And I search but never find, hurt but never cry
I work and forever try but I'm cursed, so never mind
And it's worse but better times seem further and beyond
The top gets higher the more that I climb
The spot gets smaller, and I get bigger
Tryna get into where I fit in, no room for a nigga
But soon for a nigga it be on, motherfucker
'Cause all this bullshit just make me strong, motherfucker
So I pick the world up
And I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
Yeah, bitch, I'ma pick the world up
And I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
Yeah, and I could die now, rebirth, motherfucker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth, motherfucker
I'm gone, motherfucker, I'm gone
I know what they don't wanna tell you
Just hope you're heaven-sent and you're hell-proof
I, I'll walk up in the world and cut the lights off
And confidence is the stain they can't wipe off
Early in the mornings when I think about you
Yeah - I hit you like what you sayin'?
In the mornings when I wanna fuck you
Yeah - I hit you like what you sayin'?
I could fuck you all the time
I could fuck you all the time
M-O--T
That's the fuck we sippin'
That's the fuck we drippin'
Traphouse still tippin'
Facetime when I'm gone
She give me dome from a distance
And she love to climb on top
Cause she love to walk off limpin'
Pimps up, hoes down
Legs up or toes down
Why she jock me? Cause she knocked knees
And we got trees, so Mary go around
Gotta know I ate it
She so sweet, now and later
I want that all the time, all the time

Where you been? Where you been all my life?
Baby, it's a sin, the way you look in the light
It's obvious that I want something from you
You know what, what I wanna do, do, do
If we touched it would bring me to life
I could only imagine, only imagine what it'd be like
Oh, every time,
It would bring me to life
I could only imagine, only imagine what it'd be like
What it'd be like,
What it'd be like, like, like
What it'd be like, like, like...
I saw you from afar
Thought I'd say, "What's up?"
You can tell me your name, when we waking up
They call me Tunechi, I'm good, I'm Gucci
