Something takes a part of me
Something lost and never seen
Every time I start to believe
Something's raped and taken from me... from me
Life's gotta always be messing with me (You wanna see the light)
Can't it chill and let me be free? (So do I)
Can't I take away all this pain (You wanna see the light)
I'd tried to every night, all in vain... in vain
Sometimes I cannot take this place
Sometimes it's my life I can't taste
Sometimes I cannot feel my face
You'll never see me fall from grace
Something takes a part of me
You and I were meant to be
A cheap fuck for me to lay
Something takes a part of me
Feelin' like a freak on a leash (You wanna see the light)
Feelin' like I have no release (So do I)
How many times have I felt disease? (You wanna see the light)
(1409617727513)Hey, I'm feelin' tired
My time is gone today
You flirt with suicide
Sometimes that's okay
Do what others say
I'm here standing hollow
Falling away from me
Falling away from me
The day is here, fading
That's when I'm insane
I flirt with suicide
Sometimes kill the pain
I can always say
It's gonna be better tomorrow
Falling away from me
Falling away from me
Beating me down
Beating me, beating me
Down, down
Into the ground
Screaming some sound
Beating me, beating me
Down, down
(1409617727513)Keep holding on when my brain's ticking like a bomb
Guess the black thoughts have come again to get me
Sweet bitter words unlike nothing I have heard
Sing along, mockingbird, you don't affect me
That's right
Deliver it to my heart
Please strike
Be deliberate
Wait, I'm coming undone
Irate, I'm coming undone
Too late, I'm coming undone
What looks so strong, so delicate
Wait, I'm starting to suffocate
And soon I anticipate
(1409617727513)Hate, something, sometime, someway
Something kicked down the football
Mine, something inside.
I'll never ever follow.
So give... me... some... thing... that... is... for... real.
I'll never ever follow.
Get your boogie on.
Get your boogie on.
Hate, something, someway, each day
Feeling ripped off again no.
Why? This st inside.
Now everyone will follow.
So give... me... noth... ing... just... feel.
And all the st will follow.
God thanks me
The more I see the lie.
Who wants to see?
God told me
(1409617727513)Hey you, hey you
Devil's little sister
Listening to your
Twisted transistor
Hold it between your legs
Turn it up, turn it up
The wind is coming through
Can't get enough
A lonely life
Where no one understands you
But don't give up
Because the music do
Music do, music do
Music do, music do
Music do, music do
Because the music do
And then it's reaching
Inside you
Forever preaching

(1409617727513)Are you ready?
This place inside my mind,
A place I like to hide.
You don't know the chances,
What if I should die?
A place inside my brain,
Another kind of pain.
You don't know the chances,
I'm so blind, blind, blind.
Another place I find,
To escape the pain inside.
You don't know the chances,
(1409617727513)Y'all pretty ladies around the world
Got a weird thing to show ya
So tell all the boys and girls
Tell your brother, your sister and your mama too
We're about to go down and you know just what to do
Wave your hands in the air like you don't care
Glide by the people as they stop to look and stare
Do your dance, do your dance
Do your dance quick
Mama, come on baby tell me what's the word
Word up
(Up, Up)
Everybody say
When you hear the call you've got to get it underway
Word up
(Up, up)
It's the code word
No matter where you say it, you know that you'll be heard
(1409617727513)This time I'm taking it away, I've got a problem
With me getting in the way, not by design
So I take my face and bash it into a mirror
I won't have to see the pain, bleed, bleed.
This state is elevating, as the hurt turns into hating
Anticipating all the fucked-up feelings again.
The hurt inside is fading
This shit's gone way too far
All this time I've been waiting
Oh, I cannot grieve anymore
For what's inside awaking
I'm done, I'm not a whore
You've taken everything and
Oh I cannot give anymore.
My mind's done with this
Okay, I've got a question.
Can I throw it all away?
Take back what's mine
So I take my time
Guiding the blade down the line
Each cut, closer to the vein, bleed, bleed.
(1409617727513)I am clearly broken and
No-one knows what to do
Pieces of the puzzle don't fit
So I pound them into you
Itching is the pulse inside
Creeping up to come alive
It's just doing what
It's gonna do
Times are looking grim these days
Holding on to everything
It's hard to draw the line
Shut the fuck up! Get up!
Shut the fuck up! Get up!
Shut the fuck up! Get up!
I can't wait to wet my eyes
(1409617727513)As it all falls down, do I walk away?
Or do I stand my ground and accept my fate?
And there's the faceless cries that twist my every dream
And almost every night I hear the demon sing
Why are we going on this way?
Why do we play these games in vain?
Nothing's gonna break it down and build us back again
So why did the path have to lead this way?
Black is the soul that's led astray
You're leading me to places I can never follow
Happiness is found in the darkest ways
And as I searched around, I knew nothing but mistakes
(1409617727513)Realize that I can never win
Sometimes feel like I have failed
Inside where do I begin?
My mind is laughing at me
Tell me, why am I to blame?
Aren't we supposed to be the same?
That's why I will never tame
This thing that's burning in me
I am the one who chose my path
I am the one who couldn't last
I feel the life pulled from me
I feel the anger changing me

(1409617727513)Don't wanna be sly and defile you
Desecrate my mind and rely on you
I just wanna break this crown
But it's hard when I'm so run down
And you're so cynical
Narcissistic cannibal
Got to bring myself back from the dead
Sometimes I hate the life I made
Everything's wrong every time
Pushing on, I can't escape
Everything that comes my way
Is haunting me, taking its sweet time

(1409617727513)I dream of the past, so I can break through
The walls I have built inside
The thoughts I can't grasp
Transparent, see through
They constantly fight and collide
I'd love to see a different world
A place where you can't find me
Feel me, kill me, my backs up against the wall
Your magic spell doesn't work anymore
Kill me, kill me, that's what you've got to face, my friend
(My friend)
This ain't the end
(The end)
Why can't I relax and let it be true?
(1409617727513)Pick me up been bleeding too long
Right here, right now, I'll stop it some how
I will make it go away. Can't be here no more
Seems this is the only way. I will soon be gone
These feelings will be gone ...
Now I see the times they change. Leaving doesn't seems so strange
I am hoping I can find where to leave my hurt behind
All this shit I seem to take. All alone I seem to break
I have lived the best I can. Does this make me not a man?
Shut me off. I'm ready, heart stops
(1409617727513)Thumbing through the pages of my fantasies
Pushing all my mercy down, down, down
I want to see you try to take a swing at me, come on
Gonna put you on the ground, ground, ground
Why are you trying to make fun of me?
You think it's funny
What the fuck you think it's doing to me?
You take your turn lashing out at me
I want you crying when you're dirty in the front of me
All, all my hate cannot be bound
(Hate cannot be bound)
I will not be drowned
(I will not be drowned)
By your thoughtless scheming
So you can try to tear me down?
(Try to tear me down)
Beat me to the ground
(Beat me to the ground)
I will see you screaming
Thumbing through the pages of my fantasies
I'm above you, smiling as you, drown, drown, drown
I wanna kill and rape you the way you raped me
And I'll pull the trigger and you're down, down, down
Why are you trying to make fun of me?
You think it's funny
What the fuck you think it's doing to me?
You take your turn lashing out at me
I want you crying, when you're dirty in the front of me

(1409617727513)I am watching the rise
And fall of my salvation
There's so much shit around me
Such a lack of compassion
I thought it would be fun and games
(It would be fun and games)
Instead it's all the same
(It's all the same)
I want something to do
Need to feel the sickness
In you
I feel the reason
As it's leaving me no not again
It's quite deceiving
As I'm feeling the flesh make me bad
(1409617727513)I'm feeling mean today
Not lost, not blown away
Just irritated and quite hated
self control breaks down
Why's everything so tame
I like my life insane
I'm barricating and debating who
I'm gonna kick around
Right now
Can't find a way
to get across the hate
When I see you
Right Now
I'm feeling strange inside
I want to slash and beat you
Right Now
I rip apart the things inside
that excite you
Right Now
I can't control myself
I fucking hate you
I'm feeling cold today
Not hurt just fucked away
I'm devasted and frustrated
God I feel so bound
(1409617727513)I wouldn't be angry if you'd just fucking cried
Your tears would arouse me, refreshing my supply
The suffering is fading, I scream into the sky
Repulsion invades me, I say goodbye
Digging deep inside of me
Getting past this agony
I can't seem to get away
Another day rotting in vain!
I wouldn't be angry if things would stay the same
(1409617727513)You bumped into me
I was down and you took me up past the ceiling
You are the disease
I'm the remedy that numbs all your feelings
You come looking for me
I'm the only one that keeps you sound
Bring it down to your knees
'Cause I'm the only one that makes you, you, you, you
Take me, please take me
It's the only way, please take me

(1409617727513)Life!
Things keep ending up this way
Another notch is carved away
Hearing the thoughts of mass decay
Funny how things end up this way
Beaten down, dominated by its sound
Growing deep within my head
Softly dying, its soul is shed
Eating me all up inside
This cancer finds everything I hide
Living my life horrified
Nothing will keep this pacified and out my life
Life!
That's not right out insane
Satisfaction is delayed
(1409617727513)I'm digging with my fingertips,
I'm ripping at the ground I stand upon.
I'm searching for fragile bones,
Evolution.
I'm never gonna be refined,
Keep trying but I won't assimilate.
Sure, we have come far in time,
Watch the bow break.
And I'm sorry I don't believe,
By the evidence that I see,
That there's any hope left for me.
It's evolution!
Just evolution!
And I,
I do not dare deny,
The basic beast inside,
It's right here, it's controlling my mind.
And why,
Do I deserve to die?
I'm dominated by,
This animal that's locked up inside.
Close up to get a real good view,
(1409617727513)Y'all want a single say fuck that
Fuck that, fuck that
Y'all want a single say fuck that
Fuck that, fuck that
Y'all want a single say fuck that
Fuck that, fuck that
Y'all want a single say fuck that
Boom Boom Boom Boom
What's going on today?
We gotta break away
We've got a problem and
I think it's going to make us go down.
They think we're all the same
And always we're to blame
(1409617727513)I can't stand to let you win
I'm just watching you
And I don't know what to do
Feeling like a fool inside
Feeling all the loved you hide
Thought you were my friend
Seems it never ends
I need somebodySomeone
Can't somebody help me?
I don't need it to be
Love, just for me
Giving you with this and that
Give and get nothing back
It's all related to
All the things I do
(1409617727513)Oh i'm gonna see somehow it always seems that
i'm dreaming of something i could never be.
doesn't matter to me 'cos i will always be
that pimp i see in all of my fantasies.
I don't know your fucking name.
so what let's...
Screwing may be the only way that i can
(1409617727513)Daddy's flown across the ocean
Leaving just a memory
A snapshot in the family album
Daddy, what else did you leave for me
Daddy, what you leave behind for me?
All in all it was just a brick in the wall
All in all it was all just bricks in the wall
We don't need no education
We don't need no thought control
No dark sarcasm in the classroom
Teachers, leave them kids alone
Hey, teachers, leave them kids alone
(1409617727513)Come on, step inside,
And you will realize.
Tell me what you need,
Tell me what to be.
What's your vision you'll see?
What do you expect of me?
I can't live that lie.
Hate a sick mom with a fucked dad,
Dealing with your life dead bodies everywhere.
You really want me to be a good son,
Why you make me feel like no one?
Let me strip the plain,
(1409617727513)Ring around the roses,
Pocket full of posies,
Ashes, ashes, we all fall down.
Ring around the roses,
Pocket full of posies,
Ashes, ashes, we all fall down.
Nursery rhymes are said,
s in my head,
Into my childhood they're spoon fed.
Hidden violence revealed,
Darkness that seems real,
Look at the pages that 'cause all this evil.
One, two, buckle my shoe.
Three, four, shut the door.
Five, six, pick up sticks.
Seven, eight, lay them straight.
London bridge is falling down,
Falling down,
Falling down.
London bridge is falling down my fair lady.
(1409617727513)You can't bring me down
Already had my life turned upside down
I ride a downward spiral round and round
But I keep flying, I keep fighting
You won't ever bring me down!
I'm good, I'm fine, this life divine
No hate, no shame, no one to blame
You might disguise, your life with lies
I won't chastise
Even if you think you can bring me down
Already had my life turned upside down
I ride a downward spiral round and round
But I keep flying, I keep fighting
You won't ever bring me down, down, down, down, down!
You won't ever bring me down, down, down, down, down!
You won't ever bring me
(1409617727513)Anger inside builds within my body
Why you hate me? What have I done?
You tried to hit me!
Scream at me again, if you like?
Throw your hate at me, with all your might
Hit me 'cause I'm strange, hit me
Tell me I'm a pussy and you're harder than me
What's with you boy? Think hard
A tattooed body to hide who you are
Scared to be honest, be yourself
A cowardly man
I don't run around trying to be what's not within me
(1409617727513)I'll never love again...
(love again... love again...)
I wont ever have to pretend...
(pretend... pretend... pretend... pretend...)
I'm never gonna love again...
(love again... love again...)
DAMN!
I don't ever want to have to try
And though I lie
It never flies.
I don't ever wanna have to die.
But deep inside
The death it hides.
And I never wanna clarify
And justify
So I run and hide.
And I never wanna signify
So I pacify all the hate inside.
(Noooo...)
I'll never love again!
(Noooo...)
I wont ever have to pretend!
(Noooo...)
I'm never gonna love again!
Never gonna have to try to pretend!
Never!
Never!
(1409617727513)Sick of all these things I tried
Sick of all these lies
Nobody cares, you're just a bad man
Nobody wants you, you're a dead man
Wake me from my darkest dream
Read me from my mind
Nobody cares, you're just a bad man
Nobody wants you, you're a dead man
No problem, I've got time to kill
Nobody cares, you're just a bad man
Nobody wants you, you're a dead man
Save everyone, I've had my fill
Nobody cares, you're just a bad man
Nobody wants you, you're a dead man
Do what you say, do what you want to
Do what you say, do what you want to
Do what you say, do what you want to
Do what you say, do what you want to
We rip apart the flesh and live to see
And look at all the faces along the way
(1409617727513)Him!
Here I am different in this normal world,
Why did you tease me, made me feel upset?
Fucking stereotypes feeding their heads,
I am ugly, please just go away.
Him!
I can see it's hard to fine.
This blessing in disguise.
Him!
Why you treat me this way?
Made the hate stay.
I sound like I can never seem to escape,
All the laughing, all the pain.
If you were me, what would you do?
Nothing, probably, you'd just throw me away.
I can see it's hard to fine.
Him!
This blessing in disguise.
Why you treat me this way?
Him!
Made to hate stay.
Faget!
Faget!
Faget!
Here I am different in this normal world,
(1409617727513)You're not the right one dumb damn rapper
Not the right goddamn
Who are you to rap shit take off
And who says you're right
On top you think you'r bomb artista
But you're bent out of oooo right
Suck my dick
But don't you think that you're oooo right
Sometimes things might make me ooo ooo it makes me mad
And when it happens fuck it
(1409617727513)The hating, it's pooled inside of me
They're trying to test my sanity
Insinuating, it's all make believe
And they're ripping the child within me
Cheating the time that I have left
Bleeding my soul cause that's the bet
Giving all that that I can give
Controlling my mind that is disease
Holding my hate that is released
Scolding the hand that keeps me fed
That keeps me fed
Fed!
That keeps me fed!
Fed!
That keeps me!

(1409617727513)Beating the fall
I can't help but desire of
falling down this time
Deep in this hole of my making I can't escape
Falling all this time
We come to this place
Falling through time
Living a hollow life
Always we're taking
Waiting for signs
Hollow lives...(lives)
Fearing to fall and
Still the ground below me calls
Falling down this time
Ripping apart all
These things I have tried to stop
Falling all this time
We come to this place
Falling through time
Living a hollow life
Always we're taking
Waiting for signs
Hollow lives...
Is there ever any wonder why we look to the sky?
Search in vain?
(1409617727513)How did it start?
Well I don't know I just feel the craving.
I see the flesh and it smells fresh,
And it's just there for the taking.
These little girls,
They make me feel so goddamn exhilarated.
I fill them up, I can't give it up to me,
I'm just erasing.
I tell my lies, and I despise,
Every second I'm with you.
So I run away and you still stay,
So what the fuck is with you?
Your feelings, I can't help but rape them!
I'm sorry, I don't feel the same!
My heart inside is constantly hating!
(1409617727513)Come on!
Save some for me,
It's what I like.
I wanna play,
You know it's time.
Something is calling,
I can't keep from falling.
Come on!
It's on!
You see it's my fault,
Angels stabbing me inside.
Nothing changes,
Just rearranges for me this time.

(1409617727513)Attention all parents!
Report to your local therapist!
Report to your local church!
Report to your local Police department!
It's going down!
Glaring into my sons eyes reveals a pain,
I felt her in the day.
It was all about the pussy,
If you can get it,
A little girl like me never fucking liked it.
We ain't taking no more!
We ain't taking no more, go!
So save me!
I, I!
And the children are born!
You feel it through me!
I, I!
You're the children of the KoЯn!
Dropping smoke in the alley making noise with the double pump.
Bring your boys to the party we can double up.
Double rowdy, double 'bout it hard core teenager.
(1409617727513)You came into my life without a single thing
I gave in to your ways, which left me with nothing
I've given in to smiles, I fell for all your games
I wish so bad right now, I hadn't let you in
Won't you get the fuck out of my face? Now!
Won't you get the fuck out of my face? Now!
The sea of life, you're just a minnow
Live your life insecure
Feel the pain of your needles
As they shit into my brain
I scream without a sound, how could you take away
Everything that I was, made me a fuckin' slave
(1409617727513)How come what's wrong with you
Darling faces are some we found
Let's do what devils do
Hiding in shadows, no-ones around
Why can't I torture you
Giving pain you take it away
The little things you do
Simply I love your evil ways
Your ways!
Your ways!
Your ways!
Prey for me
I think I owe you an apology
Somehow you bring the violence out in me
I'm just a shell of what I used to be
Passion is sometimes a fucked up thing for me
This time it follows you
Nothings left, your dead on the ground
How can I covet you
(1409617727513)There you are alone,
With no hope of ever having.
Something to be proud of,
Something earned without begging.
Yes, I know you're a person,
A person close to me.
Who do think you are?
And what do you want from me?
Ball tongue!
You got the dykes off I think they'll mind me!
Ball tongue!
The rag I'm on, we are justified!
Ball tongue!
Congrats you just fucked up my make-up and shit!
Ball tongue!
What have you done for me?
Why are you at home,
Buried in your self pity?
Why do you insist on,
Living the life clean out of me?
Yes, I know you're the person,
The person that took time with me.
Does it give you the right to expect,
Your life revolves around me?
Ball tongue!
You have come to take from your buddy!
Ball tongue!
You have never been so funky!
Ball tongue!
The higgle got sick of me!
Ball tongue!
Ahh, the dick is fine for the day!
Ball tongue!
(1409617727513)Look at you feeling all good.
You can't resist.
You have to be all up in it.
Don't it feel great?
Talking shit.
I let it go.
Why don't you just leave me alone?
My heart's gonna break from the fall.
Holding on to petty things.
Feeling all the hate it brings.
Why don't you just leave me alone?
What a puss.
Think you're so tough.
(1409617727513)Close your eyes, fall asleep
Broken promises that you never keep
Drift away tonight, just drift away, alright?
We used to dream, we used to laugh
No one could tell us that this would never last
This ain't a love song, I would never give you one
No more secrets, no more lies
No more feelings or surprise
No more whispered words and lullabies
Go fuck your lies
Everything, everything falls apart
Everything, everything always hard
Everything, everything falls all apart
I'd given up, it's all I could take
My hands are shaking, my body could break
Eyes, the lower now, come on and take me out
I used to care, I used to try
(1409617727513)Let me see, all my life has been taken.
This demon haunts me.
They're waiting, help me.
You fuck me up, I'm gagged and bound.
You pick me up when I am down.
I cannot live without them.
I do not live without them.
Hey, daddy, they are taking me away.
Putting things in me.
My soul they're eating, please help me.

(1409617727513)Lately things won't go my way,
Lately everything is gray.
It feels like something,
It feels like nothing.
So I came too far!
To end up this way!
Feeling like I'm God!
Feeling there's no way!
So I'm angry for today,
Anger's the only thing I've made.
It feels like something.
No it's nothing.
(1409617727513)We are the ones taking all the pain
Falling on our faces
They don't care anyway
Anyway, now
You're the one that makes me feel like I'm alive
You're the one that pushes me all the time
All the time, now
We are hard and grey
Always fate, to do what they say
Calling me deranged
Feeling power, I must take its place some way
Never gonna run away
Seeking out the path
But the pain always gets in the way
Slowly watch me die
I'm insane, so dangerous
Don't you dare get in my way
Throwing in the towel
Got me strained, so betrayed
(1409617727513)Mother, please forgive me
I just had to get out all my pain and suffering
Now that I am done, remember I will always love you
I'm your son
Little child, looking so pretty
Come out and play, I'll be your daddy
Innocent child, looking so sweet
I rape in my eyes, and on your flesh I'll eat
You raped, I feel dirty
It hurt as a child
Tied down, "That's a good boy"
And fuck your own child
I scream, no-one hears me
It hurt, I'm not a liar
My God, I saw you watching
Mommy, why? Your own child
Little child, looking so pretty
Come out and play, I'll be your daddy
You raped, I feel dirty
It hurt as a child
Tied down, "That's a good boy"
And fuck your own child
I scream, no-one hears me
It hurt, I'm not a liar
My God, I saw you watching
Mommy, why?
It's alright
You raped, I feel dirty
It hurt as a child
(1409617727513)Mother
You're holding my heart, screaming
Motherfucker
They left me broken, bleeding
Son of
The man you loved and left for
The son of a bitch
Who tried to show me death's door
Everything's eliminated
Everything is dedicated
Tried to leave this life I hated
Living it was overrated
Love song for the dear departed
Headstone for the broken hearted
Arms to kill
More flowers to steal
Head trip for the mortal earthbound
One sip of the blood that I found
Lying here
I'm dying here
Acid
Obituaries rain down
(1409617727513)My brother, you love her,
But don't give up your instincts.
Hang onto you know what,
They'll be gone fast as you blink.
They're trained to seduce you,
Suck you dry quick as they can.
They bite down, reduce you,
Now you're barely a man.
Oh my God,
How could you deny the flood,
That's flowing through you?
Hey you, you're saying that,
She's all that you desire, liar.
Hey you, you think you can,
Throw water on this fire, liar.
(1409617727513)I should've known it from the start what I was in for.
She drank a tin full, she copied, we exchanged some info.
Called her on the tele, conversation was sinful,
Ain't playin' games, my game, retain the tempo.
And things, no shame, two sparks turned into flames.
Nymphos in the park, just dancin' in the rain.
Hook me with this fix, and look to drain my aim,
Some never retain what would then suck from your veins.
So baby I ask you... (What do you want from me)
So baby I ask you... (What do you want from me)
So baby I ask you... (What do you want from me)
So baby I ask you... (What do you want from me)
So baby I ask you... (What do you want from me)
So baby I ask you... (What do you want from me)
So baby I ask you... (What do you want from me)
So baby I ask you... (What do you want from me)
You see this time, I cannot ever love another cunt.
You drink ass slut, love twice and you'll get fucked.
