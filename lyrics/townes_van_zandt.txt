Well, won't you lend your lungs to me?
Mine are collapsing
Plant my feet and bitterly breathe
Up the time that's passing.
Breath I'll take and breath I'll give
Pray the day ain't poison
Stand among the ones that live
In lonely indecision.
Fingers walk the darkness down
Mind is on the midnight
Gather up the gold you've found
(1409617727513)Sometimes I dont know where
This dirty road is taking me
Sometimes I cant even see the reason why
I guess I keep a-gamblin
Lots of booze and lots of ramblin
Its easier than just waitin around to die
One time, friends, I had a ma
I even had a pa
He beat her with a belt once cause she cried
She told him to take care of me
Headed down to tennessee
(1409617727513)Well the drunken clown's still hanging 'round
But it plain the laughter's all died down
The tears you tried so hard to hide
Are flowin'
And a blind man with his knife in hand
Has convinced himself that he understands
I wish him well, Miss Carousel
But I gotta be a-goin'
Won't you come and get me when
You're sure that you don't need me then
I'll stand outside your window
And proudly call your name
Well the lady's been told that all of gold
Is worth so much it can't be sold
No time to weep she'll need her sleep
Tomorrow
When she carries her face to the market place
And bets it on the opening race
She can ring her bells, Miss Carousel
But her singing brings me sorrow
Won't you come and get me when
You're sure that you don't need me then
I'll stand outside your window
And proudly call your name
Well, it's always done every mother's son
Is shown that grown men never run
So they fight with all the might
(1409617727513)Sometimes I don't know where
This dirty road is taking me
Sometimes I don't even know the reason why
But I guess I keep a-gamblin'
Lots of booze and lots of ramblin'
Well it's easier than just a-waitin' around to die
One time, friends, I had a ma
I even had a pa
Well he beat her with a belt once 'cause she cried
She told him to take care of me
(1409617727513)Living on the road my friend,
Is gonna keep you free and clean.
Now you wear your skin like iron,
And your breath as hard as kerosene.
You weren't your mama's only boy,
But her favorite one it seems.
She began to cry when you said goodbye,
And sank into your dreams.
Pancho was a bandit boys,
His horse was fast as polished steel,
He wore his gun outside his pants,
For all the honest world to feel.
Pancho met his match you know
On the deserts down in Mexico,
And nobody heard his dying words.
Ah, but that's the way it goes.

(1409617727513)There's no stronger wind than the one that blows down a lonesome railroad line
No prettier sight than lookin' back on a town you left behind
There is nothin' that's as real as a love that's in my mind
Close your eyes
I'll be here in the morning
Close your eyes
I'll be here for a while
Well there's lots of things along the road I'd surely like to see
I'd like to lean into the wind and tell myself I'm free
But your softest whisper's louder than the highways call to me

(1409617727513)By townes van zandt
If I had a dollar bill
Yes, I believe I surely will
Go to town and drink my fill
Early in the morning
Little darling, she's a redhaired thing
Man, she makes my legs to sing
Gonna buy her a diamond ring
Early in the morning
Mother was a golden girl
(1409617727513)Well, won't you lend your lungs to me?
Mine are collapsing
Plant my feet and bitterly breathe
Up the time that's passing.
Breath I'll take and breath I'll give
Pray the day ain't poison
Stand among the ones that live
In lonely indecision.
Fingers walk the darkness down
Mind is on the midnight
Gather up the gold you've found
(1409617727513)I got a black widow spider for mama, Lord
Got a diamond-backed rattler for pa
Well, I got me a woman down in New Orleans
Got a friend in Arkansas
Got a morning full of make believe
Got an evening full of time
I've got the hands, pretty lady
Gonna make you grieve
Lovin' gonna make you mine
Ain't never seen your town before
And I won't be back again
I need me a place to hide my face
(1409617727513)By townes van zandt

(1409617727513)Don't you take it too bad
If you're feelin' unlovin'
If you're feelin unfeelin'
If you're feelin' alone
Don't take it too bad
'cause it ain't you to blame, babe
Lord, it's just some kind of game made
Out of all of this living
That we got left to do
(1409617727513)Well if your baby leaves you,
And you got no place to go,
Come and see me darlin',
And bring along some dough.
(Chorus)
And we'll go honky tonkin, honky tonkin
Honky tonkin, honky tonkin
(1409617727513)Well, the name she gave was Caroline
The daughter of a miner
An' her ways were free, an' it seemed to me
That sunshine walked beside her
She comes from Spencer, across the hill
She said her pa had sent her
'Cause the coal was low and soon the snow
Would turn the skies to winter
Well, she said, she'd come to look for work
She was not seekin' favors
For a dime a day and a place to stay
(1409617727513)I heard her sing in tongues of silver
I heard her cry on a summer storm
I loved her, but she did not know it
So I don't think about her anymore
Now she's gone, and I can't believe it
So I don't think about her anymore
If three and four was seven only
Where would that leave one and two?
If love can be and still be lonely
Where does that leave me and you?
Time there was, and time there will be
(1409617727513)Ride the blue wind high and free
She'll lead you down through misery
Leave you low, come time to go
Alone and low as low can be
If I had a nickel I'd find a game
If I won a dollar I'd make it rain
If it rained an ocean I'd drink it dry
And lay me down dissatisfied

(1409617727513)So close and yet so far away
And all the things I'd hoped to say
Will have to go unsaid today
Perhaps until tomorrow
Fears have built a wall between
Our lives and all that lovin' means
Will have to go unfelt it seems
And that leaves only sorrow
You built your tower strong and tall
Can't you see it's got to fall some day?

(1409617727513)Sometimes i don't know where
this dirty road is taking me
sometimes i can't even see the reason why
i guess i keep a-gamblin'
lots of booze and lots of ramblin'

(1409617727513)By townes van zandt
If I had no place to fall
And I needed to
Could I count on you
To lay me down?
I'd never tell you no lies
I don't believe it's wise
You got pretty eyes
Won't you spin me 'round
I ain't much of a lover it's true
(1409617727513)By townes van zandt
I heard her sing in tongues of silver
I heard her cry on a summer storm

(1409617727513)Where I lead me I will travel
Where I need me I will call me
I'm no fool, I'll be ready
God knows I will be
And in the meantime make a little money
And buy a little mercy
Met this morning, now he loves me
Say's he loves me
It must be easy, look around you
All around you
But you see the motion, you're not movin'
You don't know how to hold on
Just keep it loose
(1409617727513)When she had twenty years, well she turned to her mother
Saying mother, I know that you'll grieve
But I've given my soul to st john the gambler
Tomorrow comes time to leave
For the hills cannot hold back my sorrow forever
And dead men lie deep 'round the door
The only salvation that's mine for the asking
So mother, think on me no more
And winter held high round the mountains' breast
(1409617727513)By townes van zandt
Ride the blue wind high and free

If it rained an ocean I'd drink it dry
And lay me down dissatisfied
(1409617727513)If I needed you
Would you come to me,
Would you come to me,
And ease my pain?
If you needed me
I would come to you
I'd swim the seas
For to ease your pain

(1409617727513)And when you're sitting there
In your silk upholstered chair
Talking to some rich folks that you know
Well I hope you won't see me
In my ragged company
You know I could never be alone
Take me down little Susie, take me down
I know you think you're the Queen of the Underground
Send me dead flowers every morning
Send me dead flower by the mail
Send me dead flowers to my wedding
(1409617727513)By townes van zandt
Hey mama, when you leave
Don't leave a thing behind
I don't want nothin'
I can't use nothin'
Take care into the hall
And if you see my friends
Tell them I'm fine
Not using nothin'
Almost burned out my eyes
Threw my ears down to the floor
(1409617727513)When he offers his hand
Don't you turn him away
He can lead you to light
Through the darkest of days
With his love wrapped around you
You can't go astray
When he offers his hand
Don't you turn him away
In a world full of sorrow
A world full of hate
You can't wait for tomorrow
(1409617727513)By townes van zandt
My days, they are the highway kind
They only come to leave
But the leavin' I don't mind
It's the comin' that I crave.
Pour the sun upon the ground
Stand to throw a shadow
Watch it grow into a night
And fill the spinnin' sky.
Time among the pine trees
(1409617727513)By townes van zandt
Days full of rain
Skys comin' down again
I get so tired
Of these same old blues
Same old song
Baby, it won't be long
'fore I be tyin' on
My flyin' shoes
Flyin' shoes
Till I be tyin' on
My flyin' shoes
Spring only sighed
Summer had to be satisfied
Fall is a feelin' that I just can't lose.
(1409617727513)I got a brand new companion
Man, I'm gonna do my best this time
I got a brand new companion
Man, I'm gonna do my best this time
You know she cools me with her breathin'
Chases away those howlin' bottles of wine
She fits just like my guitar
Man, she's near as tall as me
She fits just like my guitar
(1409617727513)Everytime my baby and me go up town
police come and they knock me down
Cocaine all around my brain
Hey baby, better come here quick.
This old cocaine is making me sick.
Cocaine all around my brain.
Yonder comes by baby, she's dressed in red
She's got a shot-gun, says she's gonna kill me dead.
(1409617727513)When she don't need me
It makes me crazy
She say rest easy
And it makes me lazy
But when she please me
She please me all night long
My friends are leavin'
She say don't worry
They're only leavin'
There is no parting
You will be lonely
(1409617727513)Well the wicked king of clubs awoke
And it was to his queen turned
His lips were laughing as they spoke
His eyes like bullets burned
The sun's upon a gambling day
His queen smiled low and blissfully
Let's make some wretched fool to play
Plain it was she did agree
He send his deuce down into diamond
His four to hart, and his trey to spade
Three kings with their legions come
Preparations soon where made
They voted club the days commander
Gave him an army face and number
All but the outlaw jack of diamonds
And the aces in the sky
Well, he gave his sevens first instructions
(1409617727513)(Ellas McDaniel) 1956
I walk 47 miles of barbed wire,
I use a cobra-snake for a necktie,
I got a brand new house on the roadside,
Made from rattlesnake hide,
I got a brand new chimney made on top,
Made out of a human skull,
Now come on take a walk with me, Arlene,
And tell me, Who Do You Love?
Who Do You Love?
Who Do You Love?
Who Do You Love?
Who Do You Love?

(1409617727513)This nine pound hammer, it's a little too heavy
For my size, honey, for my size
I'm goin on the mountain, gonna see my baby
But I ain't comin' back, no, I ain't comin' back
Chorus
Roll on buddy, don't you roll too slow
(1409617727513)Ribbons of love
Please keep me true sane
Until I reach home on the morrow
Never never to wander again
I'm weak and I'm weary of sorrow
London to Dublin
Australia to Perth
I gazed at your sky
I tasted your earth
Sung out my heart
For what it was worth
Never again shall I ramble

(1409617727513)Don't go saying I'm leaving you
Thinking I never got close enough to stay
Time runs in, and then runs out
Starts again and it's always been that way
You're gonna drown tomorrow
If you cry to many tears for yesterday
Tomorrow's half of all you've got
So treat him good, 'cause when I'm gone, he'll stay

(1409617727513)I heard her sing in tongues of silver
I heard her cry on a summer storm
I loved her, but she did not know it
So I don't think about her anymore
Now she's gone, and I can't believe it
So I don't think about her anymore
If three and four was seven only
Where would that leave one and two?
If love can be and still be lonely
Where does that leave me and you?
Time there was, and time there will be
(1409617727513)Far across the blue water lives an old German's daughter
By the banks of the old river Rhine
Where I loved her and left her but I can't forget her
I miss my pretty fraulein
Fraulein, fraulein, look up toward the heavens
Each night when the starts start to shine
(1409617727513)At my window
Watching the sun go
Hoping the stars know
It's time to shine
Daydreams
Aloft on dark wings
Soft as the sun streams
At days decline
Living is laughing
Dying says nothing at all
Baby and I are laying here
Watching the evening fall

(1409617727513)Sometimes I don't know where
this dirty road is taking me
sometimes I can't even see the reason why
I guess I keep a-gamblin'
lots of booze and lots of ramblin'
it's easier than just waitin' around to die
One time, friends, I had a ma
I even had a pa
he beat her with a belt once 'cause she cried
She told him to take care of me
(1409617727513)Your eyes seek conclusion in all this confusion of mine
Though you and I both know it's only the warm glow of wine
That's got you to feeling this way,
but I don't care, I want you to stay
And hold me and tell me you'll be here to love me today

(1409617727513)Won't say I love you, babe
Won't say I need you, babe
I'm gonna get you babe
And I will not do you wrong
Living's mostly wasting time
I'll waste my share of mine
But it never feels too good
So let's don't take too long
Well you're soft as glass
And I'm a gentleman
We got the sky to talk about
And the world to lie upon
Days up and down they come
Like rain on a conga drum
Forget most, remember some
Don't turn none away

(1409617727513)Of those that sailed the silver ships
From Andilar I am the last
The deeds that rang our youthful dreams
It seems shall go undone
North for the shores of Valinor
Our bows and crimson sails were made
Our captains were strong, our lances long
And our liege the holy king
The hills did turn from green to blue
And vanish as on the decks we watched
But every thought in that noble company
Was forward bound
To the lifeless plains of Valinor
Where reigns the dark and frozen one
And with tongues afire and glorious eyes
We pledged our mission be
The clime from mild to bitter ran
The wind from fair to fierce did blow
Oath and prayer did turn to thoughts
(1409617727513)Well, I'm building a houseboat in heaven
To sail them, deep and holy seas
Well, I'm building a houseboat in heaven
And it's welcome aboard you sweet, sweet peace
Oh, the bow she is made of solid silver
And the hall she is made of solid gold
Now, she ain't much 'long the line's floating
(1409617727513)I'm goin' out to denver
See if I can't find
I'm goin' out to denver
See if I can't find
That lovin' colorado girl of mine
The promise in her smile
Shames the mountains tall
The promise in her smile
Shames the mountains tall
She bring the sun to shining
(1409617727513)(Townes Van Zandt)
Living on the road my friend,
Is gonna keep you free and clean
Now you wear your skin like iron,
Your breath as hard as kerosene.
You weren't your mama's only boy,
But her favorite one it seems
She began to cry when you said goodbye,
And sank into your dreams.
Pancho was a bandit boy,
His horse was fast as polished steel
He wore his gun outside his pants
(1409617727513)Well, a diamond fades quickly when matched to the face of Maria
All the harps they sound empty when she lifts her lips to the sky
The brown of her skin makes her hair seem a soft golden rainfall
That spills from the mountains to the bottomless depths of her eyes
Well, she stands all around me her hands slowly sifting the sunshine
All the laughter that linger down deep 'neath her smilin' is free
Well, it spins and it twirls like a hummingbird lost in the morning
(1409617727513)My lover comes to me with a rose on her bosom
The moon's dancin' purple
All through her black hair
And a ladies-in-waiting she stands 'neath my window
And the sun will rise soon
On the false and the fair
Sing a-too a-loor-a-lie-o
She tells me she comes from my mother the mountain
Her skin fits her tightly
And her lips do not lie
She silently slips from her throat a medallion
Slowly she twirls it
In front of my eyes
Sing a-too a-loor-a-lie-o
I watch her, I love her, I long for to touch her
(1409617727513)It's plain to see, the sun won't shine today
But I ain't in the mood for sunshine anyway
Maybe I'll go insane
I got to stop the pain
Or maybe I'll go down to see Kathleen.

(1409617727513)
