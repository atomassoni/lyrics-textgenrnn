Here comes Dick, he's wearing a skirt
Here comes Jane, y'know she's sporting a chain
Same hair, revolution
Same build, evolution
Tomorrow who's gonna fuss
And they love each other so
Androgynous
Closer than you know, love each other so
Androgynous

(1409617727513)Look me in the eye
Then, tell me that I'm satisfied
Was you satisfied?
Look me in the eye
Then, tell me that I'm satisfied
Hey, are you satisfied?
And it goes so slowly on
Everything I've ever wanted
Tell me what's wrong
Look me in the eye
(1409617727513)Bring your own lampshade
Somewhere there's a party
Here it's never ending
Can't remember when it started
Pass around the lampshade
There'll be plenty enough room in jail
If being alone's a crime I'm serving forever
Being strong's your kind
I need help here with this feather
If being afraid is a crime
We hang side by side
At the swingin' party down the line
On the prairie pavement

(1409617727513)If he was from Venus, would he feed us with a spoon?
If he was from Mars, wouldn't that be cool?
Standing right on campus, would he stamp us in a file?
Hangin' down in Memphis all the while.
Children by the million sing for Alex Chilton when he comes 'round
They sing "I'm in love. What's that song?
I'm in love with that song."
Cerebral rape and pillage in a village of his choice.
Invisible man who can sing in a visible voice.

(1409617727513)How young are you?
How old am I?
Let's count the rings around my eyes
How smart are you?
How dumb am I?
Don't count any of my advice
Oh, meet me anyplace or anywhere or anytime
Now I don't care, meet me tonight
If you will dare, I might dare
Call me on Thursday, if you will
Or call me on Wednesday, better still
(1409617727513)Goin' down to the pool hall
Lookin' for the eight ball
When it comes, when it comes
Only want a little, you need a ton
Gimme one good dose of thunder
Gimme one good dose of thunder
Gimme gimme in a hurry
(1409617727513)Well a person can work up a mean mean thirst
after a hard day of nothin' much at all
Summer's passed, it's too late to cut the grass
There ain't much to rake anyway in the fall
And sometimes I just ain't in the mood
to take my place in back with the loudmouths
You're like a picture on the fridge that's never stocked with food
I used to live at home, now I stay at the house
And everybody wants to be special here
They call your name out loud and clear
Here comes a regular
(1409617727513)God, what a mess, on the ladder of success
Where you take one step and miss the whole first rung
Dreams unfulfilled, graduate unskilled
It beats pickin' cotton and waitin' to be forgotten
We are the sons of no one, bastards of young
We are the sons of no one, bastards of young
The daughters and the sons
Clean your baby womb, trash that baby boom
Elvis in the ground, no waitin' on beer tonight
Income tax deduction, what a hell of a function
It beats pickin' cotton and waitin' to be forgotten
We are the sons of no one, bastards of young
(1409617727513)I'll write you a letter tomorrow
Tonight, I can't hold a pen
Someone's got a stamp that I can borrow
I promise not to blow the address again
Lights that flash in the evening
Through a crack in the drapes
Jesus rides beside me
He never buys any smokes
(1409617727513)God, what a mess, on the ladder of success
Where you take one step and miss the whole first rung
Dreams unfulfilled, graduate unskilled
It beats pickin' cotton and waitin' to be forgotten
We are the sons of no one, bastards of young
We are the sons of no one, bastards of young
The daughters and the sons
Clean your baby womb, trash that baby boom

It beats pickin' cotton and waitin' to be forgotten
We are the sons of no one, bastards of young
(1409617727513)Yea kid, it's a really hip
With plenty of flash and you know it
Yea Dad, you're rocking real bad
Don't break your neck when you fall down laughing
Donna, wanna, donna
Yea I know, I look like hell
Smoke and I drink and I'm feeling swell
Yea, I hear you think it's weird
But I don't give a single shit
Yea man, it's a hip when y'all say it
It's a hip when y'all say it and I hear it
My heart aches, it's a looking for a dolly
(1409617727513)On the bus, that's where we're riding
On the bus, okay, don't say "hi" then
Your tongue, your transfer
Your hand, your answer
On the bus, everyone's looking forward
On the bus, I am looking forward
And it really ain't okay
I might die before Monday
They're all watching us
Kiss me on the bus
(1409617727513)God, what a mess, on the ladder of success

(1409617727513)If it's a temporary lull
why'm I bored right outta my skull?
Man I'm dressin' sharp an' feelin' dull
Lonely, I guess that's where I'm from
If I was from Canada
then I'd best be called lonesome
And if it's just a game
Then I'll break down just in case
Oh yeah, we're runnin' in our last race
Well laughed half the way to Tokyo
I dreamt I was Surfer Joe
And what that means, I don't know
(1409617727513)In my waxed up hair and my painted shoes
Got an offer that you might refuse
Tonight, tonight, we're gonna take a stab
Come on along, we'll grab a cab
We ain't much to look at so
Close your eyes, here we go
We're playin' at the talent show
Playin' at the talent show
Come on along, here we go
Playin' at the talent show
Check us out, here we go
Playin' at the talent show

(1409617727513), , , 
She don't wear no pants and she don't wear no tie
Always on the ball, she's always on stride
Struttin' up the aisle, big deal you get to fly
You ain't nothing but a waitress in the sky
You ain't nothing but a waitress in the sky
Paid my fare, don't wanna complain
(1409617727513)I could live without so much
I can die without a clue
Sun keeps risin' in the west
I keep on wakin' fully confused
I never seen no mountain
Never swam no sea
City got me drownin'
I guess it's up to me
I can't live without your touch
I can't live without your touch
Cold without so much
(1409617727513)Oooo well, well, well
I bought it
Down on all fours
Let me crawl
If I want I
Could die
Oh by
My hand
Time for decisions to be made
Crack up in the sun
Lose it in the shade
Razzle dazzle razzle droll
Time for this one to come home
Razzle dazzle razzle die
Time for this one to come alive
And hold my life
Until I'm ready to use it
Hold my life
Because I just might lose it
Because I just might lose it
(1409617727513)Get me out of this stinkin' fresh air
Ninety days in the electric chair
Step right up son
Gonna show you something ain't never been done
You're all fucked
Listen, it don't cost much
I lay down the line you touch
(1409617727513)I'll write you a letter tomorrow
Tonight I can't hold a pen
Someone's got a stamp that I can borrow
I promise not to blow the address again
Lights that flash in the evening,
Through a crack in the drapes
(1409617727513)Well when you open that bottle of wine
You open a can of worms every time
Now you don't stop, that ain't true
Never said a word, I never had to
It was my attitude
That you thought was rude
It was my attitude
Old habits are hard to break
And I don't know how much I can take
What I think is on the tip
(1409617727513)Hush was the first word you were taught
And they watched you wear
The clothes they claimed that they bought
They brought you down
To watch the merry-go around
In fall, you knew how much it cost
A trouble doll
Around your neck when you lost
You wouldn't make a sound
But I could hear your little heart pound
And I watched your feet slip off the ground
Merry go round in dreams
Writes 'em down, it seems
When she sleeps, she's free
Merry go round in dreams
(1409617727513)Read about your band in some local page
Didn't mention your name, didn't mention your name
Sweet Georgia breezes, safe, cool and warm
I headed up north, you headed north
On and on and on and on
What side are you on?
On and on and on and on
What side are you on?
(1409617727513)I gotta hide, I gotta run
Try suicide, well that ain't no fun
Oh you won't ever say that it's so
You're in love and I'm in trouble
Yeah!
Spend my cash, waste my time
Take out the trash, not this time
(1409617727513)Read about your band in some local page
Didn't mention your name, didn't mention your name
Sweet Georgia breezes, safe, cool and warm
I headed up north, you headed north
On and on and on and on
What side are you on?
On and on and on and on
What side are you on?
(1409617727513)Out on the street for a living
You know it's only begun
They've got you under their thumb
Out on the street for a living
And it is only begun
Doing all that you can
(1409617727513)One, two, three, four
Your radio is playin' rather loud
It don't sound like me
Your attitude you know, not so proud
That don't bother me
I'm gonna keep on knockin'
Gonna keep on poundin'
I knock, I'm gonna pound
I'm gonna knock
I'm gonna kick, kick your door down
Gonna kick, kick your door down

(1409617727513)You take the skyway, high above the busy little one-way
In my stupid hat and gloves, at night I lie awake
Wonderin' if I'll sleep
Wonderin' if we'll meet out in the street
But you take the skyway
(1409617727513)Oh, no... okay... tape's rolling... so what?
I hate music
Sometimes I don't
I hate music
It's got too many notes
I hate my high school
Sometimes I went
I hate music, man
Never heaven sent

(1409617727513)One more chance to get it all wrong
One more chance to get it all wrong
One more night to do it all wrong
One more warning
One more warning sound
We're comin' out
We're comin' out
We're comin' out
One more day anyway
One more chance anyway
One more night anyway
(1409617727513)I need a god damn job
Oh I need a god damn job
I really need a god damn job
I need a god damn job
God damn it, god damn it
God damn, I need a god damn job
I need a god damn girl
(1409617727513)God, what a mess, on the ladder of success
Where you take one step and miss the whole first rung
Dreams unfulfilled, graduate unskilled
It beats pickin' cotton and waitin' to be forgotten
We are the sons of no one, bastards of young
We are the sons of no one, bastards of young
The daughters and the sons
Clean your baby womb, trash that baby boom
Elvis in the ground, no waitin' on beer tonight
Income tax deduction, what a hell of a function
It beats pickin' cotton and waitin' to be forgotten

(1409617727513)I'll write you a letter tomorrow
Tonight I can't hold a pen
Someone's got a stamp that I can borrow
I promise not to blow the address again
Lights that flash in the evening,
Through a crack in the drapes
(1409617727513)Well, I was walking through the jungle just the other night
I heard about a rumble and it thought it was a fight
Stopped for a listen and I had to move my feet
It was a jungle drummer and a knocked out beat
Jungle, jungle
Jungle, jungle rock
Jungle, jungle
(1409617727513)Delivering noise
Real tough boys
What else have I got
Half-priced drugs
Stolen guitars
What else is new
It's somethin to du
Somethin to du
Well it ain't nothin new
Stand around and sweat
Girls you bet
Sure beats working too (she'll be 22? )
(1409617727513)On the bus, that's where we're riding
On the bus, okay, don't say "hi" then
Your tongue, your transfer
Your hand, your answer
On the bus, everyone's looking forward
On the bus, I am looking forward
And it really ain't okay
I might die before Monday
They're all watching us
Kiss me on the bus
(1409617727513)Well she's kind of like an artist
Sittin' on the floor
Never finishes, she abandons
Never shows a soul
And she's kind of like a movie
Everyone rushes to see
And no one understands it
Sittin' in their seats
She opens her mouth to speak and
What comes out's a mystery
Thought about, not understood
She's achin' to be
Well she dances alone in nightclubs
(1409617727513)I could live without so much
I can die without a clue
Sun keeps risin' in the west
I keep on wakin' fully confused
I never seen no mountain
Never swam no sea
City got me drownin'
I guess it's up to me
I can't live without your touch
I can't live without your touch
Cold without so much
(1409617727513)Well apathy's got a hold on me
And it won't let go
Tell me your problem, I'll tell you mine
Motherfucker you're gonna know
Well I can go for a change
Go for a jog
Tell me about your rock band
Tell me about your job
(1409617727513)We're gettin' noplace fast as we can
Get a noseful from our so-called friends
We're gettin' nowhere quick as we know how
We whirl from town to town treatment bound
First thing we do when we finally pull up
Get shitfaced drunk try to sober up
There'll be no pose tonight no money in sight
Label wants a hit and we don't give a shit
Because we're gettin' noplace as fast as we can
(1409617727513)Raised in the city
Ready to run
Cruise to the lake
Fun fun fun
Disinclined to groove around
Raised in the city
Raised on beers
She gets rubber
In all four gears
Disinclined to lay down
Get outta my way
I can't see it
Outta my way
Can't see no band
Raised in the city
(1409617727513)Look me in the eye
Then, tell me that I'm satisfied
Was you satisfied?
Look me in the eye
Then, tell me that I'm satisfied
Hey, are you satisfied?
And it goes so slowly on
Everything I've ever wanted
Tell me what's wrong
Look me in the eye
(1409617727513)(words in the background are in parenthesis)
(ok)
Top of the mornin'
I go, anywhere you want to be?
I don't give it but I can feel better
Top of the mornin'
one more
anyone want to be here?
Little windows, where'd that pin go?
Wake up
Wake up
Wake up
Wake up and wonder where you are
Top of the mornin'
Tell me, anywhere you wanna be?
(1409617727513)Stay right there, go no further
Don't get a doctor, don't get my mother
It's too far to walk, gotta decide
Turn around, we're takin' a ride
So, take another pill from your purse
Take a little ride in a hearse
We're takin' a ride
We're takin' a ride
We're takin' a ride, take me

(1409617727513)Try to breathe some life into a letter
Losing hope, never gonna be together
My courage is at its peak
You know what I mean
How do you say you're okay
To an answering machine?
How do you say goodnight
To an answering machine?
Big time's got its losers
Small town's got its vices
A handful of friends
One needs a match, one needs some ice
(1409617727513)If he was from Venus, would he feed us with a spoon?
If he was from Mars, wouldn't that be cool?
Standing right on campus, would he stamp us in a file?
Hangin' down in Memphis all the while.
